# network-vis

This repository hosts material for constructing visualizations of the connections among Biology courses at UBC's Okanagan campus.  
Using a network approach, skills and concepts relevant to reproducibility are represented as nodes, and these are connected by edges to biology courses, which are represented by another type of node.

Eventually, course nodes will link out to syllabi and other course-specific information, and the concepts and skills nodes will link to a diversity of learning resources, including vignettes, videos, etc...
