**ASSIGNMENT 3 ( /20) DATA SHEET**

1.  "Graphically" represent your results in the space below.

> Opportunity for #Skill/Data_visualization in #Potential/RLanguage. Also can refer to #Potential/Biology_data_presentation_guidelines for proper figure formatting 

2. Describe what "statistics" (i.e. mathematical calculations) you used to explore/interpret your results and show sample calculations. Â  Explain what these values represent.

> Connection to #Skill/Descriptive_statistics and #Skill/Interpreting_results 

> Similar to BIOL 116 comment, not sure if it would be too early for them to consider doing an actual #Potential/Hypothesis_testing and full #Potential/Statistical_analysis to see whether differences are significant. They would be able to use #Potential/RLanguage regardless even if they just calculate #Skill/Descriptive_statistics such as mean and SD

**For next lab:**

* Submit your formal lap report draft electronically or hard copy before start of lab

> Could so another #Potential/Peer_review before submitting their final report. Again focusing on #Potential/Revising_the_research_lifecycle 

* Rubric for the lab report can be found on Canvas
* 10% daily late penalty with a zero mark for anything submitted 48 hours late
