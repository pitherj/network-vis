## PART I. ANIMAL TISSUES

**INTRODUCTION**

As multicellular organisms, both plants and animals face similar obstacles, depending upon where they live. For example, on land they both face desiccation, exposure to UV light and the need for structural support. Large plants and animals require a system for transporting materials from one part of the organism to another. Plants and animals have found common solutions to some of these “problems” and vastly different solutions to others. Part of the answer, for most multicellular organisms, is to delegate work. Cells become specialized early in development for different roles. Cells that perform the same function are usually grouped together in **tissues** that localize functions to specific regions of the organism. Different tissues that interact to carry out related functions form **organs**, and organs with related functions are grouped into **organ systems**.

Animal tissues are classified into 4 broad categories: **epithelial tissue**, **connective tissue**, **muscle tissue** and **nervous tissue**. You will study examples of each tissue type and relate their structure to function. Complete the answers to the questions associated with Part I that are found at the end of this section. 

**PROCEDURE**

You will examine a series of prepared slides from the slide box assigned to you or on demonstration in the lab. Please take care to return each slide to its proper position in your slide box and in the proper orientation. There is a legend inside the lid of the slide box to assist you. 

### A. EPITHELIAL TISSUE (EPITHELIUM)

Epithelial tissues form coverings or linings for most of the organs in animal bodies. For example the outermost layer of your skin is an epithelium, as is the soft inner lining of your intestine. Functions of epithelia depend on their location. Epidermal (skin) epithelium is a protective barrier that prevents desiccation and keeps out pathogens such as bacteria. The epithelium lining your intestine is highly permeable and functions to secrete enzymes into the intestine and absorb nutrients from digested food. In general, epithelia are made up of cells in close association with each other, such that passage of material through the layer is highly regulated. In this lab we will focus on the epidermis, which is the epithelium covering the skin.

1. **Examine the prepared slide of frog epithelium**. This is a “top down” view of the outer layer of skin. Notice how the cells fit together like jigsaw pieces, making a uniform barrier. Cells are large and flat, with a central nucleus. Frog skin is very permeable - water can easily pass through these cells, which makes frogs especially vulnerable to desiccation and damage from water pollutants.  **Draw what you observe and label the characteristics specific to this tissue.**

2. **Look at the prepared slide of a section of mammal skin (#15)** (monkey or human) showing the layers of epidermis and some of the dermal tissue below it. In cross-section the flat, outermost epithelial cells are very thin and difficult to pick out. Notice how the outermost layer is a different colour and appears shriveled. This is because the outermost cells are dead and are filled with **keratin**, a protein that provides waterproofing. This dead layer offers protection from desiccation and abrasion. It is constantly sloughed off, or worn off and replaced with new cells from “below”. You may see hair follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous glands that extend into the dermis. Compare what you see in the slides to the skin models available in the lab. **Draw what you observe and label the characteristics specific to this tissue.**

3. **Make a slide of your cheek cells**. The epithelium lining your mouth is much like frog skin, but thicker. Put a drop of saline on a glass slide. Using a toothpick, gently scrape a few cells from the inside of your cheek, stir them into the drop of saline and add a drop of methylene blue to stain them. Notice the “fried egg” shape similar to that of the frog cells. In this case, however, you are looking at individual cells, rather than an intact epithelium. Dispose of this slide and the toothpick in the biohazardous waste container provided. **Draw what you observe and label the characteristics specific to this tissue.**

### B. CONNECTIVE TISSUE

There are general types of connective tissue including loose and dense connective tissue as well as specialized types including adipose, cartilage, bone, and blood. In contrast to the tightly packed cells of epithelial tissues, the cells in connective tissue are usually found scattered throughout an extracellular matrix containing fibres of various types. Each type of connective tissue secretes a distinct type of extracellular matrix. Thus the structure and function of different connective tissues vary widely. For example, loose connective tissue provides strength to organs and attaches epithelial tissue to underlying tissues. Dense connective tissue forms the dermis (lower layers of the skin) as well as rope like structures such as tendons and ligaments. Cartilage and bone are highly organized connective tissues that make up the skeletal system of many animals. Blood is the least organized connective tissue and serves as the transport system for most animals. Its cells are suspended in plasma that carries, among other things, nutrients and wastes throughout the body.

1. **Examine the prepared slide of bone.** Cells are embedded in a dense **matrix** composed primarily of a tough rubbery substance called **collagen**. In bone, the collagen is hardened by the addition of calcium and phosphorus salts. The cells, called **osteocytes**, are arranged in concentric rings around a **central canal** that contains blood vessels and nerves. Thin projections of cytoplasm radiate in all directions from the osteocytes and facilitate the movement of nutrients and wastes through the mineralized part of the bone. The minute channels that they occupy in the bone are called **canaliculi**. New bone tissue is continually replacing older bone thus bone is a metabolically active tissue that requires a substantial blood supply. Note: if you see areas of black on your slide, it is because the cells and blood vessels are gone and only the spaces that they occupied in the bone are left. These spaces are filled with dark stain or bone dust. **Draw what you observe and label the characteristics specific to this tissue.**

2. **Examine the prepared slide of hyaline cartilage**. The matrix is composed of collagen fibers but without the mineralization found in bone. This allows it to be strong and supportive while remaining flexible. Unlike other connective tissues, cartilage does not contain blood vessels. Because of this, it may heal more slowly than other connective tissue. The cells in cartilage when they are embedded in the matrix are called **chondrocytes**. Note how they are situated in tiny chambers called **lacunae** surrounded by matrix. **Draw what you observe and label the characteristics specific to this tissue.**

3. **Examine the prepared slide of blood** under 400x. You will see hundreds of thousands of tiny pink discs. These are **erythrocytes** (red blood cells**)**, the most numerous cells in blood. They are anucleate and are stained a pale pink or red colour. The plasma that contains these cells is a fluid matrix. Among the many erythrocytes you may also see a few cells with darkly stained nuclei – these are **leukocytes** (white blood cells**)**. **Draw what you observe and label the characteristics specific to this tissue.**

### C. MUSCLE TISSUE

There are three main types of muscle tissue in vertebrates: **smooth**, **skeletal,** and **cardiac**. Cardiac muscle like ours is not found in invertebrates - they have muscle types that resemble smooth or striated or something in between and a few of them have muscle types that resemble nothing in our bodies. In this lab, we will focus on muscle tissues found in vertebrates.

1. **Examine the prepared slide of smooth muscle**. Also called visceral or involuntary muscle, this tissue is comprised of small cells that are loosely organized and individually wrapped with connective tissue. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of hollow organs. Smooth muscle cells can sustain contraction for long periods, which is necessary for the maintenance of tone in organs such as blood vessels. Large tracts of smooth muscle can be found in the gut, blood vessels, the bladder, and the eye. **Draw what you observe and label the characteristics specific to this tissue.**

2. **Examine the prepared slide of skeletal muscle**. Skeletal muscle is attached to the bones of the skeleton. This type of muscle tissue is responsible for voluntary movements of the body. It is composed of elongated multinucleate cells called muscle fibers that are oriented parallel to each other and bound together with connective tissue. The interior of each cell is occupied by parallel bundles of contractile protein (actin and myosin) called **myofibrils**, arranged so precisely within each fiber that the pattern they make is visible as dark and light striations. The nuclei are found only at the periphery of the cells. Because of its highly organized structure, skeletal muscle is capable of exerting a great deal of force, although it cannot sustain contractions for as long as smooth muscle can. **Draw what you observe and label the characteristics specific to this tissue.**

3. **Examine the prepared slide of cardiac muscle**. As its name implies, cardiac muscle is found in the walls of the heart. This tissue is made up of striated branching cells each with a central nucleus and a large number of mitochondria. The cells are dependent on a good blood supply. Special intercellular junctions called **intercalated** **discs** ensure that electrical impulses generated in one part of the heart pass quickly from cell to cell in an orderly and directed fashion, and that adjacent cells are firmly connected. On your slide, these discs appear as dark lines at the junction of two cells. **Draw what you observe and label the characteristics specific to this tissue.**

### D. NERVOUS TISSUE

Nervous tissue is found in the brain, spinal cord and nerves throughout the body. It is excitable tissue that transmits signals from one part of the body to the other. The main cell type in nervous tissue is the neuron. Neurons have large central bodies and long, thin processes called **axons** (outgoing information) and **dendrites** (incoming information). Several types of **neuroglia** or **glial cells** are found in nervous tissue. These cells support and sustain the function of neurons in a variety of ways. For instance, some act as macrophages engulfing bacteria and cellular debris, while others form supportive scaffolding for the neurons. Glial cells are non-excitable and make up about half the mass of the brain.

1. **Examine the prepared of a spinal cord smear.** Locate a large neuron with distinct processes. Don’t worry if the surrounding tissue obscures many of the processes. Note the large central nucleus. It is difficult to distinguish between axons and dendrites but you may be able to identify an axon by finding the “axon hillock”. This is a cone-shaped “bulge” in the cytoplasm found at the base of the axon. Sometimes it is lighter in colour than the surrounding cytoplasm. You will also see the smaller, darkly stained glial cells in the surrounding tissue. **Draw what you observe and label the characteristics specific to this tissue.**

## PART II. PHYLUM PORIFERA

The simple animals in this phylum are the sponges. The name Porifera means "pore bearer." Of the 10,000 plus species known to exist, all are aquatic (mostly marine). They can be found attached to rocks, shells, or other substrates. Brilliant purple, red and orange sponges can be found below the intertidal zones or in tide pools on Vancouver Island beaches. Freshwater sponges can be found in Okanagan Lake. There are both simple and complex sponges. Complex sponges have folded body walls, many branched water canals and many **oscula** (large pores).

### A. DIGESTION, AND TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE

Sponges are multicellular but lack the tissues and organs associated with most multicellular organisms. The body of the sponge is like a perforated sac. The interior of the sac is called the **spongocoel**. The wall consists of an outer layer of epidermal cells and a gelatinous middle layer consisting of wandering **amoeboid cells** and crystalline **spicules**. Interior to the middle layer is an inner layer of flagellated cells, which are feeding cells called **choanocytes**. Water is pulled into the sponge through small pores in the sponge walls. The beating of the flagella of the choanocytes causes the directional flow (see Figure1). 

Sponges are suspension feeders meaning they capture food particles suspended in the water that passes through their body. With respect to digestion, food particles are trapped in a mucous layer associated with the choanocyte. The food particle is digested by the choanocyte or is transferred to an amoeboid cell that ingests particles through phagocytosis. Thus, the amoeboid cell facilitates the choanocyte in the digestion process.

Gas exchange is via simple diffusion across cell membranes. Oxygen is brought in with the water. Carbon dioxide and other wastes are expelled with the water as it leaves the sponge through one or several **oscula** (sing. osculum).  The spongocoel is continuous with the external environment, because it is connected by the pores and oscula. There are no tissues or organs, thus there is no transport of gases within the body of the sponge. There is little need for a transport system since all the cells in the body of the sponge are very close to the external environment.
Look at the variety of sponges on display. Observe the different forms of sponges and compare specimens 1 and 2. Answer the following questions.

**Look at the prepared slide of the simple sponge,** **Leucosolenia** **(#9)**. 

1. Identify the cells on this slide. Draw and label 

> Would be good to include all drawings in an #Potential/Open_notebooks and refer to #Potential/Biology_data_presentation_guidelines if we include how to do a proper journal style drawing in the guidelines. Also helps them with formatting their figure caption appropriately.

2. Besides being different sizes, explain how specimens 1 and 2 differ from each other.


3. Are organ and organ systems observable in these specimens and slides? Explain. 

4. How do sponges obtain and digest food? 

### B. EXCRETION AND OSMOREGULATION

These animals are aquatic and not particularly active, therefore diffusion across the body surface is sufficient to meet their excretion and osmoregulation needs.  Ammonia is a metabolic waste, which although very toxic, poses little problem for aquatic animals because the water normally dilutes and carries it away.

1. What type of compound is the major metabolic waste of Porifera? Why is it important for the organism to get rid of this compound? 


### C. REPRODUCTION

Sponge gametes (egg or sperm) arise either from amoeboid cells or choanocytes. Most sponges are hermaphrodites, meaning that each individual functions as both male and female in sexual reproduction by producing sperm and eggs. Eggs reside in the middle layer whereas sperm exit the osculum with help from the water current. Fertilization occurs in the middle layer where zygotes develop into flagellated swimming larvae. The larvae get dispersed from the parent sponge and land on a suitable substrate. Most sponges can reproduce asexually through fragmentation of the adult sponge.

1. Where do the larvae of sponges originate? How are they dispersed? 

## PART III. PHYLUM CNIDARIA

Cnidaria, which contains over 9,000 species, includes jellyfish, sea anemones, corals and hydroids. All are aquatic, most are **carnivores** and all have radial symmetry. They have two definite tissue layers but no distinct internal organs. Their name is derived from the **cnidocytes** or thread cells that they use to sting and adhere to prey. They have definite tissue layers but no distinct internal organs, no head and only a nerve net for a nervous system. They have muscle tissue that is enervated by the nerve net and as such they can swim with a somewhat slow pulsating action, bend their body and extend their tentacles in order to ensnare prey. As a result of this activity, they are more metabolically active than sponges.

### A. DIGESTION

The Cnidaria have a **"one-opening" digestive cavity** called a **gastrovascular cavity**, which serves as both the mouth and anus. Undigested food is expelled back through this opening. This phylum possesses unique stinging cells (**cnidocytes**) that are used in the capture of food. When a small animal contacts a tentacle, the cnidocytes on the tentacle expel stinging threads (**nematocysts)** that entangle and poison their prey. The attached tentacles then pull the animal into the central gastrovascular cavity where it is partially digested and then phagocytized by cells in the wall. Undigested food is expelled back through the gastrovascular cavity. There is enough poison in some jellyfish such as the sea wasp, or the Portuguese jellyfish, to severely harm, or even kill, human beings. Even the moon jellies found on our west coast need to be handled with care and caution taken to avoid touching your eyes after handling them. 


Observe the different forms of Cnidaria on display. Then answer the following questions.

1. **Look at the prepared slide of** **Physalia** **(#10)** (the Portuguese Man o’ War) tentacles and identify the cnidocytes. What are the structures inside these cells?  


2. Examine specimens 1 and 2? Identify specimens 1 and 2 and explain how they differ from each other. 


### B. TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE (CIRCULATION AND RESPRATION)

In Cnidaria, the relatively thin gastrovascular cavity is positioned close to the external environment, thus allowing for easy gas exchange. Gas exchange also occurs across the general external body surface, as a result, body cells are seldom far from the external environment. Look at the jellyfish and sea anemones on display and observe their simple structure, their central gastrovascular cavity and other characteristics that would aid in circulation and respiration. Answer the question relating to circulation and respiration below.

1. Describe how gas exchange and transport occurs within Cnidaria. 



### C. EXCRETION AND OSMOREGULATION

These animals are aquatic and not particularly active; therefore diffusion across the body surface is sufficient to meet their needs.  Ammonia is a metabolic waste, which although very toxic poses little problem for aquatic animals because the water normally dilutes and carries it away. Answer the following questions.

1. Identify three functions of the gastrovascular cavity in Cnidarians. 


2. How do excretion and osmoregulation occur in Cnidarians?


### D. REPRODUCTION

The two body types in Cnidarians include a relatively stationary polyp (eg. anemone) and a more motile medusa (sea jelly). Not all Cnidarians have both body types. Cnidarians can reproduce both asexually and sexually in both the polyp and the medusa stages. Asexual reproduction can occur through budding, fission and fragmentation. In sexual reproduction, gametes are usually released from the mouth of a polyp or medusa and fertilization takes place in the open water. Fertilized eggs hatch into larvae. When a polyp form is produced, larvae then find a suitable substrate and produce a polyp.

1. Draw the life cycle of a typical sea jelly consisting of a feeding and sexual reproductive form. You do not have to draw pictures just name the forms and indicate where fertilization and meiosis occur.

## PART IV. PHYLUM PLATYHELMINTHES

These are the flatworms. Some Platyhelminths are pathogens; the most familiar are the tapeworms that live in intestines and the flukes that live in blood vessels and other body organs. Swimmers itch is caused by a parasitic fluke that invades the wrong host. It then dies in the skin and causes a dermatitis. Many aquatic Platyhelminths are not pathogenic. An example is the freshwater flatworm, Planaria, which is common in our creeks and ponds. The body of free-living (meaning non-pathogenic) flatworms is primarily muscle tissue and thus they are quite active in their lifestyle. Some marine flatworms (which are often quite brilliantly coloured) swim quite effectively in a complex undulatory fashion. They lack a coelom and they lack structures that are specialized for gas exchange such as blood vessels or any other type of transport system.

### A. DIGESTION

The Platyhelminths have a one-opening gastrovascular cavity like the cnidarians but it is usually more branched and thus surface area is enhanced which facilitates their more active lifestyle and their digestion efficiency.

Observe the activity of the live freshwater Planarium under the dissecting microscope and answer the following questions.

1. How are flatworms more complex than cnidarians? 


2. Observe a live Planarium, provide a quick sketch of it and label the major structures. 

> Would be good to include all drawings in an #Potential/Open_notebooks and refer to #Potential/Biology_data_presentation_guidelines if we include how to do a proper journal style drawing in the guidelines. Also helps them with formatting their figure caption appropriately.

### B. TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE

The flatworms have a one-opening gastrovascular cavity like the cnidarians but it is usually more branched and thus surface area is enhanced, which facilitates their more active lifestyle and the efficiency of transport and exchange. **Observe the prepared slide planaria (#34).**

1. Why are flatworms flat? 


### C. EXCRETION AND OSMOREGULATION

Flatworms possess structures called protonephridia that function primarily in osmoregulation in non-parasitic forms. A **protonephridium** is a system of tubes in which one end is capped with cells called **flame bulbs**. The cilia of the flame-bulb project into the tube and the beating of the cilia causes fluid and solutes to be drawn into the tubules from interstitial spaces. The fluid then passes to the outside of the worm’s body through pores.

1. Describe how excretion and osmoregulation is enhanced by a protonephridium. 



### D. REPRODUCTION

Some planarians can reproduce asexually through fission. The parent constricts roughly in the middle of its body. Each end then regenerates the missing parts. Planarians sexually reproduce and they are usually hermaphrodites. Copulating mates typically cross-fertilize each other. 

1. Describe how flukes sexually reproduce. Describe how tapeworms reproduce.  



2. Identify specimens 1 and 2 on demonstration.
