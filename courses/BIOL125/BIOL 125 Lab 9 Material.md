# MAMMALIAN RESPIRATION, CARDIOVASCULAR, AND NERVOUS/SENSORY SYSTEMS


## PART I. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

### A. BACKGROUND TO GAS EXCHANGE AND CIRCULATION

Animal life is dependent on the adequate delivery of gases and nutrients throughout the body, and a properly functioning cardiovascular system provides this. One of the most fundamental needs of all organisms is the need for energy, energy in a form that can be utilized by cells. We know that cells utilize energy in the form of the molecule ATP, and that ATP is produced in the mitochondria when glucose or related substances are "burned", i.e., when they have combined with oxygen to produce CO2 and H2O. Single-celled organisms receive both oxygen and glucose (or glucose substitutes) by diffusion from their immediate surroundings. Diffusion alone however is usually inadequate to ensure sufficient nutrient supply to cells over distances of more than about 0.5 mm. So in large organisms, cells are rarely more than 2-3 cells away from a vascular system that distributes oxygen and nutrients and removes wastes.

### B. MACRO AND MICROANATOMY OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

In the typical mammalian respiratory system, air enters the body through the mouth or nasal passageways and then passes through the **pharynx** (throat) and the **larynx** (voice box) to the **trachea**. The trachea branches into two **bronchi** immediately before entering the lungs and the bronchi branch into progressively smaller **bronchioles**. The trachea and larger bronchial passageways are banded with rings of cartilage to give rigidity so they do not collapse during inspiration. The smallest bronchioles each connect to a cluster of microscopic sacs called **alveoli**, which have capillaries around their walls. This is where the actual gas exchange occurs; oxygen readily diffuses through the thin, moist walls of the alveoli into the capillaries while carbon dioxide moves the opposite way. The enormous surface area of the millions of alveoli combined with their extensive vascularization makes the mammalian lung an efficient respiratory organ. 



**HUMAN BODY – MODEL** 

Look at the human model, identify the labeled structures.

2. Why do capillaries and not arteries surround alveoli? **(  /1)**



3. Where is partial pressure of oxygen in the lung the highest? **(  /1)**



## PART II. HEART AND CIRCULATORY SYSTEM

All mammals have a 4-chambered heart (two atria and two ventricles) and a double circulatory system. The heart acts as a double pump, its left side sending fully oxygenated blood throughout the body (**systemic circulation**) while the right side sends deoxygenated blood to the lungs (**pulmonary circulation**). Deoxygenated blood returning to the heart from the body is not mixed with oxygenated blood returning from the lungs, as is the case with reptiles and amphibians. The efficiency of a double circulatory system is believed to have been instrumental in the evolution of **endothermy**. Warm-blooded animals require a highly efficient mode of circulation to distribute oxygen to support their higher metabolic rate. 

Arteries branch and rebranch forming smaller arteries and **arterioles,** which branch to form **capillaries**. Exchange of nutrients and wastes within the tissues occurs across the thin walls of microscopic **capillaries**. Blood returns to the heart through **venules** and **veins.** Blood is circulated to the tissues by **arteries** that carry blood away from the heart and returned to the heart by **veins**.


## A. MACROANATOMY OF THE HEART

**HEART – MODEL** 

1. Draw the flow of blood through each side of the heart and label all major parts. Be sure to indicate whether the blood is oxygenated or deoxygenated. **(  /3)**

> Would be good to include all drawings in an #Potential/Open_notebooks and refer to #Potential/Biology_data_presentation_guidelines if we include how to do a proper journal style drawing in the guidelines. Also helps them with formatting their figure caption appropriately.

2. Histology of the circulatory system; examine a prepared slide of a small artery and vein in cross section. The vessel with the thicker more muscular wall is the artery. 

3. How do the walls of these vessels differ? **(  /1)**

4. How are the structural differences of these vessels reflective of functional differences? **(  /1)**

**CARDIAC CYCLE – ELECTROCARDIOGRAM**

In a person at rest, the heart beats about 75 times each minute or over 100,000 times in the course of a day, each beat following the next without conscious thought. With each heartbeat, the atria contract simultaneously forcing blood into the ventricles and the ventricles contract simultaneously forcing blood out through the two major arteries leaving the heart. Each contraction is followed by relaxation and a complete cardiac cycle consists of the contraction and relaxation of both atria and ventricles. The **sinoatrial (SA) node**, located in the wall of the right atrium, is the normal pacemaker of the heart. Under the influence of various neurotransmitters and hormones, it generates the electrical impulses that control the heart rate. Each impulse causes positive ions to cross cell membranes and starts a wave of depolarization that rapidly spreads throughout the atrial walls causing them to contract. The impulse also passes to the **atrioventricular (AV) node** where, after a short delay, it travels into the ventricles along specialized conduction pathways. The wave of depolarization then spreads throughout the ventricular walls causing the ventricular contraction. The delay in the AV node ensures that the atria finish their contraction before the ventricles begin theirs. Before the next cardiac cycle, positive ions must recross the cell membranes to restore the original ion concentrations. This electrical activity is referred to as **repolarization**.

**PROCEDURE – OBTAINING YOUR CARDIAC CYCLE**

A small amount of the electrical activity associated with the heartbeat spreads to the surface of the body where it can be picked up and recorded by an **electrocardiograph**. This machine makes a record of the changing voltage measured between pairs of electrodes as a function of time. The recording is called an **electrocardiogram** or **ECG**. Figure 6 is part of an ECG strip produced by electrodes attached to both wrists and the left ankle. This is just one of a dozen electrode attachment configurations, each of which “looks” at the heart from a different direction. The wave labeled “P” shows the voltage changes caused by the depolarization of the atria prior to contraction. The QRS “complex” of waves shows the voltage changes caused by the depolarization of the ventricles prior to contraction. The T wave results from the repolarization of the ventricles. Atrial repolarization occurs at the same time as ventricular depolarization therefore it is masked by the QRS complex.

> Ask students to make note of any major adjustments that had to be made to emphasize #Potential/Research_transparency 

Disconnect the wires from the electrodes but leave the electrodes in place on your wrists and ankle. Exercise by vigorously running in place for two minutes. Quickly connect the electrode wires and record your exercise ECG.

5. Label the peaks of your ECG and attach the printout to your assignment. What is the difference in your ECG before and after exercise? **(  /2)**

### B. BLOOD PRESSURE

Measuring blood pressure can give you information regarding the heart's pumping efficiency and also on the condition of the blood vessels. The **systolic pressure**, which you will record in the brachial artery (above the elbow), occurs during contraction of the heart's ventricles. **Diastolic pressure** occurs in between heartbeats while ventricles are relaxed. The normal resting systolic pressure for a 20-year-old male is 120-129 mm Hg. The normal diastolic pressure is 80-84 mm Hg. Values less than this are considered optimal in the absence of pathology. Normal and optimal pressures for women are 8-10 mm less than those for men. Pressures increase with activity level with systolic pressure approaching 200 mm during vigorous exercise.

Hypertension (high blood pressure) occurs when the arteries lose their elasticity due to atherosclerosis or other conditions. A systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater and/or a diastolic pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater indicates hypertension. An elevated systolic pressure tends to indicate hypertension in older adults (50+) while an elevated diastolic pressure indicates the condition in younger adults. An increase in the **pulse pressure** (systolic minus diastolic pressure) is always an indication of decreased elasticity of arteries.

**PROCEDURE – DETERMINING YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE**

Work with a partner and carry out the following procedure, or an alternative provided to you by the instructor.

* Working in pairs, have your partner place his/her right forearm uppermost on the table (about the level of the heart).
* Wrap the cuff snugly around the upper arm about 2-3 cm above the elbow
* Follow the instructions on the sphygmomanometer to determine blood pressure.

> Again, ask students to note down any deviations from protocol. Emphasizing #Potential/Research_transparency and #Potential/Reproducibility 

1. What are your systolic and diastolic pressures? How does this relate to the norms? 

## PART III. NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SENSORY RECEPTORS

Vertebrates have extremely complex nervous systems composed of neurons and associated neuroglia cells. We have a sensory system (part of our **peripheral nervous system**, or PNS) that perceives environmental stimuli. These stimuli are interpreted by the **central nervous system** (CNS), which consists of the brain and spinal cord. A message may be then sent from the CNS to the motor component of the peripheral nervous system, directing a response. 

Three kinds of cells make up the nervous system: **neurons, neuroglia**, and **Schwann cells**. The term neuron refers to a complete nerve cell. It consists of three portions, (1) the cell body containing the nucleus, (2) the dendrites, which conduct impulses toward the cell body, and (3) the axon which conducts impulses away from the cell body. Usually dendrites are shorter than axons, and more branched. The juncture between a neuron and another cell is called a **synapse**. At most synapses information is passed from one cell to the next via chemical messengers called **neurotransmitters**. The neuroglial cells (or glia) support, nurture and protect the neurons, but it is also thought they facilitate information transfer at synapses, and it is thought that they might be part of the cellular mechanism of learning and memory. In the peripheral nervous system there are also Schwann cells that surround axons. When a Schwann cell wraps several times around an axon it forms layers of lipid and protein called the myelin sheath. The Schwann cells provide electrical insulation of the axon, and cause saltitory conduction of the impulse that increases the speed at which the signal travels. In multiple sclerosis the myelin sheaths deteriorate which results in a progressive loss of body function due to the disruption of nerve signal transmission. A bundle of neuron processes (axons and dendrites) enclosed together in connective tissue in the peripheral nervous system is referred to as a **nerve**.

1. **On the prepared slide of spinal cord smears**, try to identify the cell body, dendrites, and axons of the neuron and identify the neuroglial cells. **Examine the prepared slide of nerves in longitudinal and cross section** and identify the axon and the Schwann cells. For both of these slides of nervous tissue, draw and label the parts that you see.

### A. THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

In order to maintain homeostasis, the human body must be able to react and adjust to changes in the environment. It must be able to coordinate a huge variety of muscular and metabolic activities. This is accomplished by the nervous and endocrine systems in such a way as to maintain a stable internal environment. The nervous system, however, provides more rapid adjustments than the endocrine system and controls muscular contractions and glandular secretions.

The CNS consists of the **brain** and **spinal cord**. Nerve cells from both relay impulses that reach to all parts of the body. Some nerve fibers carry impulses to the brain and spinal cord, relaying information about both external and internal changes. Other fibers carry impulses from the spinal cord and brain, stimulating responses in certain muscles or glands. 

**BRAIN STRUCTURE**

Observe a sagittal section of the sheep brain and compare it with the model of the human brain and the photographs available. Locate the following structures and know their functions. The **olfactory bulbs and tracts** are concerned with the sense of smell, the olfactory nerves form synapses in the bulbs with the sensory receptors at the top of the nose. The tracts carry these impulses to the **cerebrum**. The highly convoluted **cerebral cortex** contains sensory areas that interpret sensory impulses, motor areas that control muscular movement, and association areas concerned with emotional and intellectual processes. The surface of each cerebral hemisphere has 4 lobes and researchers have identified a number of functional areas within each lobe. The cortex is composed of gray matter, so called to distinguish it from white matter. Gray matter is composed of neural dendrites, neural cell bodies and unmylenated axons, whereas white matter towards the interior of the brain is composed of tracts of mylenated axons. The **cerebellum** controls skeletal muscle contractions required for coordination, posture and balance. It receives information from sensory neurons about the length of the muscles, position of the joints and information from the eyes and receptors for balance and equilibrium in the inner ear. The **medulla oblongata** is involved in regulation of heart rate, respiratory rate and in other basal functions such as swallowing, vomiting and digestion. The **thalamus** is a “central sorting area”. It receives sensory impulses and relays them to the appropriate regions of the brain for further interpretation and integration. The **hypothalamus** plays a major role in maintaining homeostasis. It is the source of important hormones and also contains the body’s thermostat. It controls the flight or fight response and regulates hunger, thirst and sexual response.

### B. THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

**SENSE ORGANS**

Our sensory receptors are the only built-in instruments we have for exploring and monitoring our environment, both external and internal. The demonstrations in this exercise are intended to help you understand some of your sensory structures and their capabilities. For complex structures such as the eye and ear a review of anatomy is provided to help you understand the functions of these structures.

Each sensory structure has, as its basic units, sensory neurons, which are particularly sensitive to one kind of energy input. Inputs such as light, motion or heat are transduced by the neurons into an action potential, which travels along nerve fibers to the spinal cord or brain. Different types of receptors respond to different types of energy and transduce that energy via different mechanisms. We will look at some the different types of energy transducers found in mammals. Bear in mind that the interpretation of these energy inputs is done by the brain, not by the sensory receptors themselves.

**VISION – ELECTROMAGNETIC RECEPTORS**

Photoreceptors are the functional unit’s mammalian sight. Mammals contain two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Cones are associated with colour vision under well lit conditions, whereas rods are associated with black and white vision under dimly lit conditions. The mechanism by which cones work is not fully understood, however the mechanism by which rods transduce light energy is quite well articulated. Rods contain two light absorbing pigments called retinal and opsin. Retinal is bonded to opsin to form a compound called rhodopsin. The retinal portion of the compound changes shape when it absorbs light and causes it to detach from the opsin. This causes a series of reactions leading to the generation of an action potential. After a few minutes, enzymes will cause the retinal to go back to its original shape so that it binds to the opsin again. The photoreceptor neurons (**rods and cones**) are located in the retina. These along with other neurons transmit the potential generated in the receptor cells to the optic nerve. Determine the roles played by other major structures in the eye such as the **optic nerve** (II), **cornea**, **iris** and **lens.****MAMMALIAN EYE – MACROANATOMY** 

Observe models and posters that are available in the lab and Figure 2 below to learn the macroanatomy of the human eye and answer the following questions.

5. Name the structure labeled A, and describe its function. 


6. Name the structure labeled B and describe its function. 


7. Name the structure labeled C and describe its function. 


**RETINA – MICROANATOMY**

Cones are concentrated near the centre of our retina. They are responsible for our visual acuity and for our ability to detect colour. Anything we wish to examine critically is focussed on a tiny (00.4 mm) pit called the **fovea,** which contains only cones. Most of us have three types of cones each with different photosensitive pigments. Blue cones detect colour in the violet and blue range of the spectrum. Green cones detect blue and green colours well. Red cones detect green, yellow, orange and red. Notice how the colours detected by one type of cone overlap with some of the colours detected by the other cones. This allows us to see many gradations of colour. We see white when all three types of cones are stimulated at once and black when no cones are stimulated. Rods are photoreceptors that are more sensitive to light than cones but cannot distinguish colours. They are in highest concentration around the periphery of the retina. We use the rods in low light conditions. 

* If a darkened room has been provided, notice how you see only in black and white and can make out objects much better if you do not look directly at them. 
* 
* Sensory receptors such as rods and cones can be made to react to stimuli other than light. Try closing your eyes in a dark area, turning your eyes to the left and pressing gently on the right edge of your eyeball with your right index finger. The "image" is caused by mechanical stimulation of the rods and cones.

Examine the prepared slide of the retina. Rods and cones are located in the deepest layer of neurons of the retina. They synapse with bipolar cells that in turn synapse with ganglion cells. The nervous impulse that started with light stimulation of the rods and cones then travels along axons of the ganglion cells and via the optic nerve to the brain. A pigmented layer deep to the rods and cones absorbs light, preventing it from scattering throughout the eye.

8. Draw and label a section of the retina.

**PROCEDURE – DETERMINE BLIND SPOT AND ITS DIAMETER**

Hold your hand over your right eye. Hold the lab manual about 12 cm from your face and focus with your left eye on the “**X**” drawn below. Slowly move the lab manual away from your eye until the dot disappears. This is your blind spot. 

9. Why is there a "blind spot" where the optic nerve leaves the retina? Why don’t you perceive a blind spot in your normal vision?

**Near point of accommodation**

The lens can change its curvature to allow near and far focusing. The increase in curvature when focusing on near objects is called accommodation. A gradual loss of accommodation occurs with age as the lens loses elasticity.

A

Close one eye, focus on the letter and slowly move the page toward your eye. Measure the distance at which you can no longer see a clear detailed letter. If you wear corrective lenses, keep them on. Compare your near point with these average values:

age	10 - 7 cm		20 - 9 cm		30 - 12 cm				40 - 20 cm		50 - 50 cm		60 - 90 cm.

10. What is your near point? How does it relate to the norms? 

**VISUAL ACUITY**

To check visual acuity, stand 20 feet from the Snellen chart (there is a mark on the floor), cover one eye and read the letters on progressively lower levels of the chart. Record the fraction at the right of the smallest line where the letters were seen accurately. Test the vision of each eye separately, as well as both eyes together. In the fraction indicated (example 20/20), the first number represents the test distance of 20 feet and the second number represents the distance that the average eye can see the letters on a certain line of the eye chart. Therefore, 20/20 means that the eye being tested can read a certain size letter when it is 20 feet away. A score of 20/40, means that person can read letters at 20 feet that a person with 20/20 vision could read from 40 feet.

Work with a partner to determine your visual acuity and record the values in the spaces below.

Left eye: //////_ Right eye: //////// Both eyes: ///////_

Prescriptions for eyeglasses are measured in diopters. The measurement starts at zero ("plano"), with four quarters to a diopter: 0.25 (a quarter diopter), 0.50 (one half a diopter), 0.75 (3/4 of a diopter), and 1.00 (one diopter). The higher the numbers, the higher (stronger) the prescription.

Here are estimates for the approximate correction needed for each line seen on the Snellen chart:

**HEARING AND EQUILIBRIUM**

Hair cells are the functional units of hearing and equilibrium (as well as pressure reception along the lateral line in fishes). Deflection of the hair by a pressure source, be it a pressure wave or something rolling onto the hair, causes the cell to alter its release of neurotransmitter. 

**EAR – MACROANATOMY**

Use the available figures and model to learn the anatomy of the human ear. The ear contains cells that transduce information related to both our senses of equilibrium and hearing. The sensory nerve used here is cranial nerve VIII, the **vestibulocochlear**.**Hearing**

Sound waves are directed through the **external auditory canal** to the **tympanic membrane**. These pressure waves cause the tympanic membrane to vibrate. The vibrations are carried through the middle ear by **the middle ear ossicles** (the **malleus, incus and stapes**) to the surface of the **oval window**. Both the oval window (attached to the stapes) and the round window are membrane-covered openings into the bone that houses the inner ear. Vibrations of the oval window produce pressure waves in the fluid within the snail-shaped **cochlea**. This causes a membrane to vibrate to which hair cells are attached. The deflection of the hairs converts these pressure waves into nerve impulses that the brain perceives as sound. A greater deflection is perceived as a louder the sound. The base of the cochlea is wider than the apex, therefore the membrane in that region responds to lower frequency sounds; these signals are interpreted as lower pitched versus signals from the apex of the cochlea. The **Eustachian tube** connects the throat to the middle ear and it functions to clear mucus from the middle ear into the nasopharynx and allows for air pressure in the middle ear to equilibrate with atmospheric pressure.

11. Name the structure labeled A, and describe its function. 

12. Name the structure labeled B and describe its function. 

13. Why is your hearing often impaired after take-off in an airplane? 

**STATIC EQUILIBRIUM**

The ear also provides information on two kinds of equilibrium. The orientation of the head relative to the ground (static equilibrium) and linear acceleration are monitored by hair cells in the **saccule and utricle**. These are two chambers located in the **vestibule** behind the oval window. In both chambers clusters of hair cells are embedded in a gelatinous mass and covered with a thin layer of densely packed mineral crystals. When the head is upright, the crystals sit directly over the hair cells and push down. When the head is tilted, the force of gravity pulls the crystals to one side distorting the hair cells. This creates a pattern of nervous impulses that tells the brain that the head is not level. The perception of these inputs helps in maintaining balance and posture.

Try standing sideways in front of a lamp so that the shadow is cast on the board. With your hands at your side, feet together and with your eyes open, have your partner judge extent of sway. Repeat the procedure with your **eyes closed**. Compare your results with others.

> Ask students to note down their observations when they compare with others. Relates to #Potential/Research_transparency 

**DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM** 

Dynamic equilibrium is the maintenance of body position (mainly that of the head) in response to sudden movements or to changes in rate or direction of movement. These inputs are sensed by hair cells in the **ampullae of the three semicircular canals**. When the head moves the fluid in the canals moves over the hair cells and bends them, starting an action potential.


**CUTANEOUS SENSATION – MECHANORECEPTORS AND RAW NERVE** **ENDINGS**

The skin contains scattered receptors for touch (or pressure), which function by distortion in a way similar to hair cells. Other receptors such as those for heat, cold and pain are little more than blind-ended neurons imbedded in the skin. See Figure 4 for the sensory receptors found in the skin.

**TOUCH RECEPTORS**

**Pacinian corpuscles** are considerably large, encapsulated in onion-like rings of connective tissue and located in the subcutaneous layer. These corpuscles respond to direct heavy pressure. Examine the prepared slide of Pacinian corpuscles. **Meissner’s corpuscles** are located in the upper region of the dermis of the skin and are specialized for light touch sensations. Examine the demonstration slide of Meissner’s corpuscle if there is one available.
