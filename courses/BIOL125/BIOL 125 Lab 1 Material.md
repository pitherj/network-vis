## The Experimental Method

### Step One: Observation of phenomena and formation of a question.	

The first step in any research is to decide on a *"problem"* or focus for the investigation. This often happens when you observe something that interests you. This will form a "question", such as "why did it do that?" This is the first task you and your group members must determine. The question you ask must be informed by existing knowledge and relevant research.

> Could emphasize how publication #Potential/Bias might affect what is available in the literature. 

You may consider using mealworms or mung beans for your research project. Your research question must include the effect of “x” on some physiological parameter such as survival, some aspect of behaviour, growth, germination rate etc.

### Step Two: Form your hypothesis

> Connection to #Concept/Hypothesis

A hypothesis is an unproved conclusion or explanation for the observed phenomena. In its simplest form, a hypothesis is a "guess" or intuitive hunch that is proposed as a tentative answer to a problem or question. 

Any good hypothesis must meet several criteria. 

* The hypothesis must be "**testable**"
* A second criterion is that a good hypothesis must be based on **measurable, describable facts.** 

> Should emphasize #Potential/aPriori_hypothesis and the problems associated with #Potential/HARKing. Another characteristic of a hypothesis is that it should be falsifiable 

Two hypotheses are stated at the same time: 

* The null hypothesis (Ho) which states that the factor being tested will have no effect on the outcome (i.e. there will be no difference) 
* The alternate hypothesis (Ha), which states that the factor being tested, will have an effect on the outcome. 


### Step Three: Design of an experiment and the gathering of data to test the hypothesis

> Might be able to work on #Potential/Revising_the_research_lifecycle by having them #Potential/Peer_review each other's #Skill/Study_design

An experiment is a procedure designed to describe the factors, in a given situation, that affect one another under certain conditions. Ideally experiments should be conducted with these criteria in mind:

* The experimenter has control over every **variable.** A variable is any factor that might affect the outcome of the experiment. 
* The experimenter manipulates the "**independent variable**". An “**independent variable**” is a variable that is not dependent on any other variable.
* The experimenter observes the effects of the “**independent variable**” on the "**dependent** (or **response**) **variable**". “**Dependent variable**” is a variable that depends on that of another variable.
* The experimenter must use one specimen (or group of specimens) as a “**control”** against which all other experimental samples are compared. The “**control**” is a specimen (or group of specimens) you are investigating under normal circumstances.
* The experimenter must design an experiment that is “**repeatable**”. That is, others should be able to follow the same procedures and attain similar results.

1)	In the space below, state your "hypotheses" and write a one-sentence rationale.

2)	In the space that follows, briefly describe your experimental design. Make sure that you answer each of the following questions: 

> Might be important to ask students what types of #Potential/Statistical_analysis they can use with their #Skill/Study_design . This is something that should be considered during the design process

	A) What variable(s) will you test? 



	B) How many "runs/trials" do you want to make, in the 		time provided?

> Could ask students why they think it's important to include multiple trials to emphasize the importance of #Concept/Replication 

	C) What is your "experimental group" and what are your 	   treatment levels? What is your "control group"? What 	is your sample size?



	D) What "data" are you going to collect? What are the 	  units? 




	E) How will you record your data?




	F) How will you try to limit experimental error and 	biological variation?




	G) List all of the equipment and supplies that you 		will require to conduct your experiment including the 	  estimated numbers of each and volume if relevant.
