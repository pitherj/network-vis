# Plant Community Structure and Reproduction


## PART I. PLANT DIVERSITY: COLONIZATION OF THE LAND:

**INTRODUCTION:**

Life on land and life in water pose very different problems for organism survival.Obtaining enough light for photosynthesis is an issue in water because the water itself absorbs light as well as any suspended material. This is seldom a problem in air. Water can physically support aquatic organisms but terrestrial organisms have to provide support against gravity for themselves. This can be important in order to present a large surface area for photosynthesis and exchange of gases to occur. Water acquisition and retention is also a critical problem in terrestrial systems, since water stress limits net photosynthesis. Most importantly, in aquatic systems, sperm can swim to the egg whereas terrestrial plants had to develop fertilization that was independent of water. 

**WHAT IS A PLANT?**

Plants are multicellular, photosynthetic organisms that possess embryonic development (meaning that developing offspring are protected by maternal tissue) and which grow from only limited meristems (mostly the tips of roots and shoots). It is thought that plants are most closely related to the multicellular green algae because they share similar chloroplast structure and photosynthetic pigments, as well as a number of other features. Plants and algae both have *cell walls* that surround the cell membrane. These cell walls are made of a rigid material called cellulose; as well plants may have an additional hardening compound called lignin. In contrast, algae lack embryonic development and a waxy cuticle as their outer coating. This coating, present in terrestrial plants, protects them from drying out. 

**PLANTS SHOW ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS:**

Plants have a complex life cycle involving alternation of haploid and diploid generations (Figure 4). The **sporophyte** is the diploid generation. Sporophytes produce haploid **spores** by meiosis. The spores grow into haploid **gametophytes,** which produce **gametes** by mitosis. (Note that this is different from animals, which produce gametes by meiosis.) Female and male gametes fuse to form diploid zygotes, which then grow into sporophytes. Within Kingdom Plantae there has been an evolutionary trend from dominant gametophyte generations (as in mosses) to dominant sporophyte generations. In flowering plants for example, the leafy plants you are familiar with are sporophytes, the tiny pollen grains are the male gametophytes, and the female gametophyte is retained within the ovary of the flower.

## PART II. KINGDOM PLANTAE

Some taxonomic groups are more adapted to a terrestrial life style than others

### DIVISION BRYOPHYTA (mosses, liverworts and hornworts):

* Lack a vascular system and possess minimal adaptations for a terrestrial lifestyle

The simplest terrestrial plants are the Bryophytes, including mosses, liverworts and hornworts. They lack a true vascular system to transport water and nutrients. Their sperm must swim to the eggs so they need a film of water for fertilization to occur. Consequently they are small and found primarily in moist areas. 

A moss **gametophyte**, the multi-cellular haploid stage that produces gametes, is a simple leafy green plant. The "leaves" of a moss lack a vascular system and are thus not considered true leaves. Sperm are released from the male **antheridia** that are located on the tops of the male gametophytes. They swim through a film of moisture such as a rain or heavy dew. Responding to chemical attractants they swim toward **archegonia** on the tops of the female gametophytes where they fertilize the egg cells. The resulting diploid zygote divides by mitosis and produces the diploid **sporophyte** (spore-producing structure).  The capsule of the sporophyte produces **spores** by meiosis. These eventually are released to form new gametophytes. The first, filamentous, structure formed by the germinating spore is termed the **protonema**. Biologists have noticed that the protonema is very similar to green algae and some have hypothesized that mosses evolved from filamentous green algae.

**MOSS LIFE CYCLE:**

**Questions**

Examine the moss plants provided.

3. What is lacking in the *Sphagnum*? 


### DIVISION PTERIDOPHYTA (PTEROPHYTA) (FERNS):

* Possess vascular tissue, have some adaptations for a terrestrial lifestyle

Ferns are true vascular plants; they have **xylem** and **phloem** to transport nutrients and water. Xylem is a system of dead, tube-shaped cells that transport water and mineral nutrients from the roots upwards in the plant. Phloem is a system of living, tube-shaped cells that transport water and organic nutrients in multi-directions around the plant. Although ferns are most prevalent in moist environments some species have adapted to hot dry desert conditions. One such fern is *Woodsia,* which is quite common on dry talus slopes in the Okanagan.

Since ferns have a vascular system they can grow much taller than Bryophytes. In the Carboniferous era ferns reached heights of over forty meters. Tree ferns today may be many meters tall. Ferns have true leaves with veins of xylem and phloem. The leaves usually have a waxy coating on their upper surface. In most ferns the leaves, commonly called **fronds**, are compound (divided into leaflets). The young leaves, known as fiddleheads, are tightly coiled. As the leaves grow they gradually uncoil. Ferns also have primitive root systems for anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil. Associated with the root system are fungi, called mycorrhizal fungi. Nutrients actually pass between the plant roots and the fungal hyphae. Carbon compounds move from the plant to the fungus, and mineral nutrients move from the fungus to the plant root.

The large, leafy stage of the life cycle is the sporophyte generation. Spores are formed by meiosis inside of **sporangia** on the underside of the fronds. The sporangia are clustered together in **sori** (sing. = sorus). When conditions are right a row of specialized cells dehydrates and shrinks, thereby tearing the sporangium open to release the spores. Spores germinate and form small heart-shaped gametophytes. The gametophyte (called the **prothallus**) is photosynthetic but has no vascular tissue or epidermis. **Archegonia** and **antheridia** develop on the prothallus. When there is enough moisture sperm swim from the antheridia to the archegonia to fertilize the eggs. The sporophyte then grows out of the gametophyte. 

**FERNS:**

**Questions**

Look at the demonstration ferns on display. 

4. Is there evidence of true vascular tissue? 


5. Are any sori visible, if so where? 



Make a wet mount of a **sorus**, if they are available, and look for **sporangia**.

6. Can you guess (rough) how many sporangia were in your sorus? 




7. What happens when you apply pressure to the cover slip (Gently, with the eraser from a pencil? 



**Look at the prepared slide of the prothallus.** 

8. What reproductive structures are present on a prothallus? 



9. Is the prothallus the gametophyte or sporophyte generation? 


Look at the poster of the life cycle of the fern. 

10. Do ferns exhibit dominance of the sporophyte or gametophyte generation? 


### DIVISION CONIFEROPHYTA (CONIFERS):

* Possess vascular tissue, are well adapted for a terrestrial lifestyle, wind is primary mechanism for dispersal of pollen and seed.

![C:\Users\tristhay\Desktop\Conifer_cone_park.jpg](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/L4LEGW7mdT-C3IXbCtgOfW6WMxmDY7KnOkkWiY3DmzIgwg_pIPkkNT3_OtbcxWhn_poa65JHNWzNoA4_Vdx-A482DvMtn8Gjb1gFRevXq8egtAjjhLx4vMLVJAV0E7k5eSXXZZk)http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Conifer_cone_park.jpg

Conifers are fully terrestrial plants. The plant that we see in everyday life is the sporophyte stage. They have well-developed vascular tissue for transport and support, small, well-coated leaves (their needles) so that evaporation is largely under the control of the plant. They have a well-developed root system that anchors the plant well into the ground and can access supplies of ground water. Very importantly, they do not rely on water for fertilization.  

The reproductive structures of conifers are **cones**, which are clusters of modified leaves called **scales**. In female cones each scale has two ovules on the upper surface. The ovules contain spores that develop into female gametophytes. In male cones the sporangia are found on the underside of each scale. Spores within the sporangia develop into pollen grains, which are the male gametophyte. 

The pollen grains of conifers have little bladders or wings. Conifer pollen is transported to the female cone by the wind and the bladders help with wind dispersal. When a pollen grain lands on a female cone (that contains ovules and the female gametophytes which produce egg cells) it develops a **pollen tube** that slowly grows towards the egg cell in the female gametophyte (in the ovule). When it finally reaches the female gametophyte (this may take more than a year) a sperm cell is released to fertilize the egg. The seed develops on the surface of the cone scale. The cones stay tightly closed until the seeds are mature. A seed consists of a sporophyte embryo within a protective coat. It also contains a food supply derived from the female gametophyte.Most of the trees that we call evergreens are members of Division Coniferophyta. Locally, Douglas fir, larch, ponderosa pine, red cedar and juniper are all members of this division. Conifers are a type of gymnosperms, which are plants with “naked seeds”. This means that the ovules and seeds of these plants are not enclosed in fruits as they are in the flowering plants (Division Anthophyta).


**THE PINE:**

**Questions**

Review the poster of the life cycle of the pine. 

11. Where do you find the gametophyte generation? 


**Look at the prepared slide of the male cone** and observe the developing pollen grains. Observe them under 4 x magnifications and note their wing-like shape. 

12. What is the purpose of the wings? 


Look at the male cones on display. These cones release large amounts of yellow pollen each spring, enough so that some will likely land on a first year female cone.

13. Are the structures you can observe *macro*scopically part of the sporophyte or gametophyte generation? 


**Look at the prepared slide of the female cone**. 

In some of the ovules you may see a large cell. This is the spore that will form the female gametophyte. If seeds are visible in the cone, note that two seeds are found on each scale and that each one has an attached wing. 

14. What structures are visible? 



15. Is the seed part of the gametophyte or sporophyte generation? 









### DIVISION ANTHOPHYTA (FLOWERING PLANTS):

* Well-developed vascular system, possess many adaptations for a terrestrial lifestyle, utilize flowers and fruit to attract animals to aid in the dispersal of pollen and seed.

Like conifers, the flowering plants that we see are the sporophyte generation. These are the only plants that have flowers. The purpose of the flowers with their colourful petals and sepals is to attract animals to carry pollen from the male to the female structures of the flower. This has led to many fascinating and often complex adaptations as flowers co-evolved with insects, birds, bats, etc. Some flowering plants have reverted back to wind pollination with a subsequent reduction of floral structures.

Fertilization of the egg occurs via pollen tubes similar to conifers. Anthophyta are angiosperms, which means "seed in a container.” This refers to the specialized structure, the **fruit**, which encloses the ovules and the seeds of all member of this division. The fruit is actually swollen *ovary wall*. Fleshy fruit also helps to attract animals, which then disperse the offspring away from the parent plants. As with the conifers, Anthophyta have well developed root systems. Many have leaf adaptations and waxy coatings that reduce the amount of uncontrolled evaporation. The leaves have entrances (stomata) into their interior that can open or close via guard cells, and thus loss of moisture from the plant can be controlled.
