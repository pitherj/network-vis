**For next week:**

* Run statistical analysis on your data 
* Bring laptop and power cord and ensure you have downloaded R and R Studio from the power point on Canvas

> Since they have to find 3 primary papers this is a good opportunity to introduce how to do a #Skill/Literature_review and #Potential/Critical_analysis  of papers.   
  
> Again might be able to implement #Potential/Open_notebooks for the data collection so students are compelled to write down anything interesting that arises throughout the process in a transparent way. ( #Potential/Research_transparency ) 
  
> Also might be able to introduce the idea of proper #Potential/File_and_data_management.
