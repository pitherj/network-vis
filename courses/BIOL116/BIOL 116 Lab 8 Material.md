# Data Tutorial

**R workshop preparation**

> Connection to #Skill/RLanguage

**What to bring to the lab**

* Laptop
* Power cord
* Patience

> Good opportunity to emphasize why #Potential/RLanguage  is such a great tool to use and how it contributes to #Potential/Reproducibility and #Potential/Open_science 

**To complete prior to coming to lab:**

* Install “R” 
	* To install R on your system, figure out what operating system (and 	   version) you have on your computer (e.g. Windows 10; Mac OS) 
	* Go to http://cran.r_project.org/, click on the appropriate download 		link at the top
	* For Windows users, download the “base” version; this file will be 		called something like R-3.3.3-win.exe, depending on the version 		number.  Executing this file launches a familiar Windows Setup Wizard 	     that will install R on your computer. 
	* For Mac users, download the “pkg” file that is appropriate for your 		version of MacOS; the file will be called something like R-3.3.3.pkg (again 	this depends on the current R version number).  Download and run this 	     installation package – just accept the default options and you will be 	ready to go.
* Install RStudio:
	* https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and click on 		the green “download” button underneath the “RStudio desktop FREE” 		column.
	* Then click on the appropriate link under the “Installers for Supported 	  Platforms” heading: this again depends on what platform/operating 	system you are using.  It will likely be one of the first two options.
* Launch RStudio to make sure it is working
	* Take some time to familiarize yourself with RStudio
	* When using a new installation of RStudio, the default behavior is to 		save all your objects to an ‘RData’ file when you exit, and loads the same 	       objects when you open RStudio.  This is dangerous behavior, and you 		must turn it off.  Make sure you go to Tools – Global Options and 		then the General tab, and make sure the settings are as follows:
		* No check – Restore.RData into workspace at startup
		* Save workspace to. RData on exit: Never
		* No check – Always save history (even when not saving. RData)
* Create a new directory on your own laptop for the workshop (e.g. “r_workshop”)
* Choose a dataset from your research project to work on and save it as a “CSV” file on your computer within your workshop directory.

**ASSIGNMENT #3 ( /20)**

**DATA SHEET**

1.	"Graphically" represent your results in the space below.

> Opportunity for #Skill/Data_visualization in #Potential/RLanguage 

2.  Describe what "statistics" (i.e. mathematical calculations) you used to explore/interpret your results and show sample calculations.   Explain what these values represent.

> Since they aren't doing any formal #Potential/Hypothesis_testing they can't really say whether or not significant differences exist. It might be important to clarify that their "interpretation" of the results is missing that piece but that they will learn more about tests in BIOL 202. Or we might be able to provide them with the basics for completing a #Potential/Statistical_analysis. Or are they expected to just discuss whether #Skill/Confidence_interval overlap or not? 


> Students calculate #Skill/Descriptive_statistics and #Skill/Interpreting_results
