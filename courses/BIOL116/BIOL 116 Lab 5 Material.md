# Genetics

**LEARNING OUTCOMES:** 

**At the end of this lab period, students should:**Understand basic Mendelian genetics and how to solve genetics problems.	

## Genetics

Genetics is the scientific study of heredity and hereditary variation. Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, discovered the basic principles of genetics through experimentation with peas in the 1860’s. He demonstrated that some traits are passed on to offspring as discrete factors we now call genes and that these genes occur in pairs (on homologous chromosomes in most plants and animals) and segregate randomly during the formation of gametes (during meiosis). The study of traits that are inherited this way is called Mendelian Genetics and is the focus of this lab exercise. The more complex patterns of inheritance, such as incomplete dominance, gene interaction, and polygenic inheritance, involve more complicated mechanisms, some of which will be dealt with later in your course. (See Chapter 13 in your text for a thorough discussion of these and other examples of non-Mendelian inheritance patterns.)

### Basic Terminology

The following are some of the terms you will encounter as you carry out this lab exercise and complete the genetics problems you will be assigned. A **gene** is a specific region of a chromosome that is capable of determining the development of a particular trait. A gene occurs in one of several alternate forms called **alleles**. The gene for flower colour in peas is a typical example. There are two different alleles of this gene, one allele for purple flowers and one allele for white flowers. Many genes have more than two alleles; for example, one of the human blood type genes has alleles for type A, type B and type O. Although each person has room for only two alleles (one on each homologous chromosome) there are three alleles in any given population.

When one allele masks the expression of another allele, the first is said to be **dominant** and it determines the **phenotype,** or observable characteristics, of the organism with respect to that trait. Alleles that are masked by the dominant allele are called **recessive** alleles. In pea plants, the allele for purple flowers is dominant and the allele for white flowers is recessive. When a pea plant has two identical alleles for a trait, it is said to be **homozygous** for that trait. If the two alleles are different, the organism is said to be **heterozygous** for the trait. For a gene with only two alleles there are three possible genotypes: heterozygotes and two kinds of homozygotes. If one of these alleles is dominant over the other then there are only two possible phenotypes (make sure you understand this before you read on).

When we describe the alleles present in an organism we are describing its **genotype.**  A dominant allele is represented by a capital letter, so if "P" represents the allele for purple pea flowers, a plant that was homozygous and purple would have the genotype PP. The white allele for this gene would be designated "p" and a homozygous plant would have the genotype pp. A heterozygous plant would have the genotype Pp. What colour would it be? The letters are purely arbitrary and you can use any letter you want in these problems as long as you define each one at the beginning of your answer. Note – for some letters it is easy to distinguish between upper and lower case when you are writing them out by hand (“a” and “A”), but for others it is difficult to tell (“u” and “U”). Make sure when you use these letters that it is clear to the reader which one you mean.

### Beyond the Basics

For some genes, one allele does not mask the other, but the two “blend” to form a third phenotype in a mechanism called **codominance** (also called **incomplete dominance**). In this case heterozygotes have a phenotype different than that of either homozygote. An example of this occurs in flower colour of snapdragons. Plants homozygous for the red allele produce red flowers and plants homozygous for the white allele produce white flowers, but heterozygotes produce pink flowers.

Using the above plants, if you bred a red-flowered plant with another red-flowered plant you would always get red flowers in the offspring but breeding pink flowers with pink flowers would not result in pink flowers. Make sure you understand this before reading on. In this sense we call homozygotes “**true-breeding**”.

When homozygotes (true-breeding individuals) for one allele are mated to homozygotes for another allele (same gene), a **cross** has been carried out. A cross following only one trait (one gene) is called a **monohybrid cross**. When two traits are considered, it is a **dihybrid cross**. For example, a cross between a plant homozygous for red flowers and homozygous for wrinkly seeds and a plant homozygous for white flowers and homozygous for smooth seeds would be a dihybrid cross. In this case we are crossing plants we know are homozygous for **two** **different** traits.

The individuals initially crossed are referred to as the parental or **P generation**. Their offspring are the “first filial” or **F****1** **generation**. If the offspring are then mated with each other the following generation is the **F****2** **generation** and so on.

**Objectives**

In this lab you will explore Mendelian genetics by observing some phenotypes displayed by you and your classmates. We will then focus on problem solving. You will be expected to:

* Learn the terms and concepts described in this section.
* Be able to solve a range of genetics problems as represented by the sample problems you are given.

### Human Genetics

The following traits all follow simple Mendelian Genetics. Learn which are “dominant” and recessive. Note that recessive does not mean rare (this is a common misconception). Record your genotypes in the table below.

**Middigital Hair**

The presence of mid-digital hair is a dominant condition; therefore, those lacking it are homozygous recessive for the trait. Look closely because even the slightest amount of hair qualifies as the dominant trait.

**Bent Little Finger**

The condition is caused by a shortened middle phalanx of the fifth finger. Because of the triangular shape of the imperfect middle segment, radial curvature of the fifth digit results. This allele is dominant. Presence or absence of the trait can be determined by placing the slightly spread fingers on a flat surface and noting the alignment of the fifth finger in relation to the other four. Those with the condition will notice a slight angling of the fifth finger toward the other digits.

**Tongue Rolling**

Those with the ability to roll the tongue upward from the side are classified as rollers and are dominant for this trait. Non-rollers are homozygous recessive for this trait.

**Widow's Peak**

Widow's peak is a distinct downward point of the frontal hairline. It’s a dominant allele in humans. Homozygous recessive individuals possess a straight hairline.  

**Earlobe Attachment**

The inheritance of a free (unattached) earlobe is caused by a dominant allele. The homozygous recessive condition causes a direct attachment of the earlobe to the head. 

**Facial Dimples**

The occurrence of dimples (natural indentations at the corners of the mouth) is controlled by a dominant allele. People without facial dimples are homozygous recessive. 

**Hitchhiker's thumb**

This is the ability to bend one's thumb backward about 45 degrees. It is called distal hyperextensibility of the thumb and is a recessive trait.

**Length of Big Toe**

The relative lengths of the big toe and the second toe are Mendelian traits. People with a long big toe are homozygous recessive for the trait. Possession of the dominant allele results in a short big toe in relation to the second toe. If one or both of the big toes are equal to or greater in length than the second toe, the recessive trait is present.

**Pattern Baldness**

This condition, which may be starting in college age students, results in thinning hair on top of the head while a fringe remains lower on the head. It is a sex-influenced trait that usually requires higher levels of testosterone in order to be visible. Check the male/female ratio in the class to see if there is a male bias. 

| Trait              | Present or Absent | Possible Genotype(s) |
|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Middigital hair    |                   |                      |
| Bent little finger |                   |                      |
| Tongue rolling     |                   |                      |
| Widow’s peak       |                   |                      |
| Earlobe attachment |                   |                      |
| Facial dimples     |                   |                      |
| Hitchhiker’s thumb |                   |                      |
| Length of big toe  |                   |                      |
| Pattern baldness   |                   |                      |



### GENETICS PROBLEMS:

The solution to each of the following genetics problems should contain certain basic elements of information (where applicable):

1.	*A definition of the alleles segregating in the cross.*For example: Let **B** represent the allele for brown hair and **b** represent the allele for blond hair;Let **L** represent long ears and **l** represent short ears.
2.	*The genotypes of the parents and of the different types of gametes that they can form.*Example: genotype - **BbLL**; gametes - **BL** and **bL**
3.	*A Punnett Square*.
4.	*If a ratio is required, include what the numbers represent, do not simply present numbers in your answer*. For example if asked for a phenotypic ratio a correct answer would read: 9 brown hair, long ears: 3 brown hair, short ears: 3 blond hair, long ears: 1 blond hair, short ears; not simply 9: 3 : 3 : 1.A genotypic ratio should give the genotypes: 9*BbLl*: *3BbLl*: *3bbLl*: *1* *bbll*

### PRACTICE PROBLEMS

1.	Mr. and Mrs. Smith have 12 children, all with brown hair. Mr. Smith has blond hair and Mrs. Smith has brown hair. With only this information, can you **positively** assign genotypes to the two parents? Explain. 

If the next 2 children also have brown hair, can you positively assign genotypes? Explain. (**Note:** For this question, assume that brown hair is completely dominant over blond hair.)

2.	In common garden peas, such as those used by Mendel in his initial breeding experiment, the allele for purple flowers (P) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (p). Similarly, the allele for tall plants (T) is dominant over the allele for short plants (t). These two genes are located on different chromosomes. (i.e. they are not linked.)For each of the following crosses, calculate the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of the offspring. (Show your work.)

	a) PPtt x ppTT		
	b) Pptt x ppTt		
	c) PpTt x pptt		
	d) PpTt x PpTt

3.	Tom, who has blue eyes, marries Sarah, who has brown eyes, and they have 2 children -- Peter, who has brown eyes, and Debbie, who has blue eyes. Both of Tom's parents have brown eyes as does Sarah's mother, while Sarah's father has blue eyes. Assuming that brown eyes can result from either a homozygous or heterozygous genotype, give all possible genotypes for the eight members of this family.

4.	In *Drosophila* there are several genes which control eye colour and shape. The gene L controls eye shape. The genotype LL produces very small eyes or "lobe" eyes, Ll produces eyes about 1/2 the normal size or "semi-lobe" eyes, and ll produces large or "normal" eyes. The gene R controls eye colour. The genotype RR produces "red" eyes, Rr produces "rust" eyes and rr produces "sepia" eyes (sepia is a dark brown colour). These 2 genes are on different chromosomes.

	a)	A red, normal-eyed female is crossed with a sepia, lobe-eyed male. What are the 	expected genotypic and phenotypic ratios in the F1 and F2 generations?
	b)	What would be the expected phenotypic ratio, if an F1 male was crossed with its 	mother? 

5.	In mice, coat colour is controlled by a gene B, with the allele for black coat colour B, being dominant to the allele for brown coat colour b. A black female is crossed with a brown male, producing a litter of 10 black and 2 brown mice.

	a) What are the genotypes of the parents?
	b) What was the expected phenotypic ratio in the offspring?

6.	In guinea pigs, rough coat (R) is dominant over smooth coat (r) and black coat (B) is dominant over white coat (b). The two genes are inherited independently. The following table illustrates the results of several different matings, each producing 100 offspring. For each mating, determine the genotypes of the parents.

							Phenotypes of Offspring
	Phenotypes of Parents		Rough   	Rough  	  Smooth  	Smooth										Black		White	Black 		White

	c) Rough, black x Rough, black	57   		19    		18    		6
	d) Smooth, black x Rough, white	49   		51    	 	0    		0
	e) Smooth, white x Rough, black	23   		24    		26   	 	27
	f) Smooth, black x Rough, white	100   		0    		0    		0


7.	In humans: (a) there is a single gene responsible for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This disease results from an enzyme deficiency and is characterized by severe self-mutilation. The gene is sex-linked and the allele n producing the disease is recessive; (b) the autosomal gene B is responsible for eye coloration, with allele B producing brown eyes and allele b producing blue eyes. A brown-eyed (heterozygous) Lesch-Nyhan carrier female marries a blue-eyed, normal man.

	a) What are the genotypes of these two people?
	b) List all of the possible genotypes and phenotypes for their offspring.
	c) What is the probability that the first child will suffer from Lesch-Nyhan?

8.	
	a) Red-green colour blindness is inherited as a sex-linked recessive trait. If a colour-blind 	    woman marries a man with normal vision, what are the expected genotypes and 		phenotypes of their children with respect to these traits? 
	b) A man and his wife both have normal colour vision, but they have a son who is colour 	blind. The man sues his wife for a divorce on grounds of infidelity. Can genetics provide 	    evidence supporting this case? Explain.

9. 	In chickens, the allele for feathered legs (F) is dominant over the allele for clean legs (f) and the allele for a pea-shaped comb (P) is dominant over the allele for a single comb (p). The two traits are inherited independently. A feathered, single comb hen is crossed to a clean legged, pea comb rooster. (NOTE: Both birds are homozygous for each trait.) What proportion of the F2 progeny would have the:

	a)	phenotype - feathered, pea comb
	b)	genotype - Ffpp
	c)	phenotype - clean legs, pea comb
	d)	genotype - FFPp
	e)	genotype - FfPp

10. Bar eyes (oblong shaped eyes) in *Drosophila* is inherited as sex-linked dominant. Normal eye shape is recessive.

	a) If a normal female is crossed with a bar-eyed male, what would be the phenotypic 	ratio of the offspring?
	b)	What is the probability of obtaining a bar-eyed female in the offspring?

11.	Black and yellow pigment in the coat of cats is controlled by a sex-linked pair of alleles which display co-dominance. The allele XB produces a black coat, the allele Xb produces a yellow coat and the heterozygous genotype results in a calico coat.

	a) If a yellow male cat mates with a black female, what would be the phenotypes and 	genotypes of the offspring?Is it possible to have a male calico cat? Explain your answer.
	b) A female calico cat has a litter of 8 kittens -- one yellow male, two black males, two 		black females and three calico females. Assuming there is a single father for the litter, 		what is his probable colour?

12.	Hemophilia, which results in poor blood clotting, is inherited as a sex-linked recessive trait. The ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, while the inability to taste this chemical is recessive. A man and his wife can both taste PTC and both have normal blood clotting characteristics. They have a son who is a non-taster and has hemophilia. What are the genotypes of these three people?
