## Introduction

All atoms and molecules are in constant motion, a phenomenon we experience as heat. The higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. This constant motion keeps the molecules evenly distributed. By chance alone, the random motions will move molecules from an area of high concentration (of that molecule) to an area of low concentration. This process is known as **diffusion** and it occurs in gases, liquids and solids. The larger and heavier the molecule the more slowly it will diffuse.

Living protoplasm is largely a watery mixture in which many materials are dissolved or suspended. This protoplasm is contained by a **cell membrane,** across which some materials can diffuse (to varying degrees) and some cannot. We refer to the membrane as being **selectively permeable**. This selectively permeable membrane has been exploited in many body functions such as digestion, excretion, muscle contraction, nerve conduction, and respiration.

If the concentration of a molecule is greater on one side of a membrane than on the other, the net movement of molecules will be from the area of greater concentration to the area of lesser concentration. The molecules are said to be moving down the **concentration gradient**. Molecules of course are moving across the membrane in both directions, but the net movement is always from greater to lesser concentration. The greater the concentration difference, the faster the rate of diffusion, limited of course by the permeability of the membrane. **Molecular size** also influences the rate of diffusion. Small molecules such as water or dissolved salts may cross easily whereas large protein and polysaccharide molecules (such as starch) will not. **Polarity** of molecules can also influence their movement across some membranes. 

Diffusion of **water** across a selectively permeable membrane is called **osmosis**. Water will continue to exhibit net osmotic movement across a membrane until the concentration of water is equal in both sides or until sufficient pressure builds up to prevent further net change. The pressure that can be produced by the osmosis of water is called **osmotic pressure** (or osmotic potential). If one solution has a greater solute concentration than that of a second solution then the first solution is **hyperosmotic** (hypertonic) to the second. The second solution is **hypo osmotic** (hypotonic) to the first (Fig. 1). Water will move from the second solution to the first. Two equally concentrated solutions are **isosmotic** (isotonic). It is important to keep in mind that these are relative terms.

**Figure 1. Movement of water by osmosis.** The membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sugar molecules. This “cell” would tend to swell.

A living cell placed in a hyperosmotic solution will shrink due to osmotic water loss. Such a cell is said to be in a **plasmolysed** condition. Plasmolysis is readily observed in plant cells, where the cell membrane pulls away from the rigid cell wall (Fig. 2). Living cells placed in a hypo osmotic solution will tend to swell due to the osmotic gain of water. Plant cells are restrained from swelling by the rigid cell wall, but they do become **turgid**. It is **turgor pressure** (osmotic pressure) that supports non-woody plants. Animal cells swell and eventually burst in hypo osmotic media.

In this laboratory session we will use a cell membrane model constructed from dialysis tubing to demonstrate the principles of diffusion and osmosis. Dialysis tubing, made of cellulose, acts as a selectively permeable membrane, permitting rapid passage of water molecules but restricting passage of larger molecules across the membrane. You will also design and conduct an experiment to investigate other factors affecting the rate of diffusion.

## Procedure

[The worksheet to completed for this lab can be accessed here](files/116-2.docx)

### A. Determination of Membrane Permeability to Molecules Based on Size {-}

Your TA has pre-cut 18-20 cm pieces of dialysis tubing, which are soaking in water. This softens the material and allows you to separate it into two layers so that you can open the tube. Remove the tubing from the water and tie one end. Place about 10 mL of starch solution into the bag and tie the open end securely. 

 > Could emphasize #Potential/Reproducibility and proper note taking strategies by explicitly asking students to note down specifically how much starch solution is added incase its more or less than 10mL. This way they can learn to keep track of any deviations from protocol. Same thing for any timings in the experiment ie. if they observe the cell for 18 minutes instead of 20.

Examine the bag for leaks and if there are none wash the bag under the tap to remove any starch remaining on the surface. Immerse the bag in iodine solution and note the time of immersion. Observe the “cell” every 3 minutes and record any colour change occurring in the starch solution. Starch in the presence of iodine becomes blue. Observe the “cell” periodically for about 20 minutes. Does the colour change become progressively more pronounced as the experiment proceeds? Record your observations. Between observations, continue with the other activities.

**Questions**

* Propose two alternative hypotheses regarding the movement of either starch or iodine. How do your observations support one hypothesis or the other?

> Connection to #Concept/Hypothesis

* Propose an explanation based on membrane permeability with respect to molecular size.

### B. Plasmolysis {-}

Place two thin pieces of red onion or two young leaves of *Elodea,* an aquatic plant, at opposite ends of a microscope slide. Add a drop of distilled water to one sample and a drop of a 3.5% NaCl solution to the other. Cover each sample with a coverslip. Observe the normal appearance of the plant cells in water and then examine the cells in the salt solution. If your timing is right you will see cells undergoing plasmolysis. Examine the cells in the salt solution again after 5 minutes; the effects of plasmolysis should be pronounced. Place the plasmolysed plant tissue into distilled water for 10 minutes, then re-examine the cells.

**Questions**

* What has happened to them? Draw and explain your observations in the space below.

### C. Effect of Concentration Gradient on Osmosis {-}

In this experiment we want to explore how a concentration gradient affects osmosis. Many scientific investigations start with testable **hypotheses** posed in terms of the independent and dependent variables. A hypothesis is an educated guess about the way a process works that allows predictions to be made. It is always a statement not a question. The **independent variable** is the factor that you manipulate (or that you have nature manipulate for you), whereas the **dependent variable** is the factor you measure that varies in response to the manipulated variable. All other variables that might affect the dependent variable must be kept constant during the course of the experiment. This way, significant changes in the dependent variable can be attributed directly to the independent variable. These variables are called **standardized variables**. The experiment is run, and the hypotheses are assessed in light of the results. In general, an experimental design involving manipulations includes the use of controls. **Controls** are used to assess changes in the dependent variable caused by factors other than the independent variable. They are often accomplished by carrying out an additional experimental treatment with the independent variable eliminated or set to a standard value. Where possible, good experimental design also includes **replication**. Replicates are used to guard against possible biases introduced by random chance, and they provide a form of insurance against “accidents”!

> Here is a connection to experimental #Concept/Replication and lots of connections to BIOL 202 in this section with respect to #Skill/Study_design and variables

Each group should obtain 5 pieces of dialysis tubing; soak them and tie one end as before. Label 5 small, empty beakers 1-5 and then fill each dialysis bag according to Table 1. After filling each bag, tie off the open end (as in the previous experiment) and place each bag in a labelled beaker. Ensure that no air is left in the bag.

**TABLE 1  Setup for different concentration gradients.**	

| System | Bag Contents          | Beaker Contents |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------------|
|      1 | 10 mL distilled water | distilled water |
|      2 | 10 mL 10% sucrose     | distilled water |
|      3 | 10 mL 30% sucrose     | distilled water |
|      4 | 10 mL 50% sucrose     | distilled water |
|      5 | 10 mL distilled water | 50% sucrose     |

Weigh each filled bag and record the weights in Table 2. Place bags 1, 2, 3 and 4 back in their beakers and, when you are ready to begin timing, add distilled water to the beakers until each bag is fully immersed. Fill the beakers at intervals of one or two minutes and note the time for each. Then place bag 5 into its beaker and add 50% sucrose solution to the beaker until the bag is immersed. Again, note the time.

**Remove the bags at 15-minute intervals, blot them quickly and gently on a paper towel, and weigh each bag. Continue readings for at least 60 minutes and record the weights in Table 2.** 

The data can be graphed in a number of different ways depending on the type of information you specifically want to convey, for example:

* as the weight of each bag as a function of time;
* the cumulative weight change as a function of time for each bag;
* the weight change for each 15-minute interval as a function of time for each bag;
* the overall rate of weight change (g/min) as a function of concentration gradient.

**Your TA will tell you which graph(s) you are to produce.**

**Questions**

Propose a hypothesis for this experiment and at the end of the experiment determine if the data supports your hypothesis.

> Might be good to put this before the methods of the experiment to reinforce #Potential/aPriori_hypothesis

Which of the five systems tested represents a control? What other control setups could have been used in this experiment?


Compare the lines on your graph for systems 2, 3, and 4. What generalization can you make about concentration gradients and the net movement of water?

Did the bag in system 4 gain weight at the same rate that the bag in system 5 lost weight? If not, why?

> Just a general formatting comment. It might be helpful to move this table to the corresponding part of the lab report where the students are asked to record these weight changes.

> Also I wonder if students might be able to use #Potential/RLanguage for #Skill/Data_visualization. Maybe students could collect the data in lab and then complete the figures as part of an asynchronous assignment.

### D. Investigation of Factors Affecting the Rate of Diffusion {-}

In addition to the concentration gradient (i.e. the difference in the concentration of particles between two environments) there are many other factors known to affect the rate of diffusion including;

* temperature
* the size of the diffusing particles
* the viscosity of the medium through which the particles move.

The purpose of this exercise is for you to work in groups to design experiments to test two of the factors listed above. You will be provided with access to the materials described below including;

* 0.5% malachite green (mw 927.1)
* 1% potassium permanganate (mw 158.04)
* 0.5% potassium permanganate
* 1% agar plates (maximum of 2 per group)
* 2% agar plates (maximum of 2 per group)
* plastic straws that could create uniform wells in the agar
* discs of paper and forceps
* pipettes (to dispense small volumes of solutions)
* crushed ice and zip lock baggies

State your hypotheses and describe your experimental designs in the spaces below and then discuss these with your TA before continuing. Be sure you have considered appropriate controls, the number of replicates you intend to run and what data you are going to collect.

**Questions**

Hypothesis #1

> Connection to #Concept/Hypothesis

Experimental Design #1

> Might be good to provide students with more guidance in terms of what they should include for their #Skill/Study_design: ie. IV, DV, any controls and also to include the protocol they will use.

> As commented above, this could be an asynchronous full lab report with an intro, methods, results, and discussion section. More reflective of registered report style #Potential/Open_science. Maybe not fully written by them but it could be a template style lab report to make it less time consuming for them. 

> If this was the case, then we could also use this as an opportunity to showcase proper #Potential/File_and_data_management practices.

Hypothesis #2

Experimental Design #2

Conduct your experiments and record and summarize your results in the spaces below.
Results for Experiment #1

> Students should create a table or figure for #Skill/Data_visualization for both of these experiments. 

Results for Experiment #2

Do your results support your hypotheses?

> As part of the discussion we could ask students what the next steps might be ie. #Potential/Replication following the detailed protocol they created above or test the hypothesis a different way with a new protocol. Again highlighting the importance of taking active steps to ensure #Potential/Reproducibility
