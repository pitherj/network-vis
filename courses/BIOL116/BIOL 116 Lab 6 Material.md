# **A Decision to Branch Out: The Evolution and the Domestication of Maize**

**Learning Outcomes:**

Students will

* Draw conclusions based on experimental data, which includes the ability to identify independent and dependent variables, as well as the difference between correlative, loss-of-function, and gain-of-function evidence.
* Compare and contrast natural and artificial selection
* Make predictions that are relevant to the effects of mutations on gene expression, plant architecture, and the evolutionary fitness of individuals within a population
* Use the history of the evolution and domestication of Maize in order to understand how transposable elements play a significant role in shaping the structure of genomes and in genetic diversity 

## Scientific Method

The scientific method is an empirical approach to the systematic investigation of natural phenomena with the goal of acquiring new knowledge.  The first step in scientific inquiry is to formulate a hypothesis based on an initial observation. 

> Opportunity to emphasize why it's important to have #Potential/aPriori_hypothesis and to avoid #Potential/HARKing 

The hypothesis is then tested and revised until there is good agreement between the empirical data and what the hypothesis predicts.

Most experiments are intended to establish correlation or causal relationship between the independent and dependent variables.  In other words, a hypothesis is usually a statement that describes how the independent variable influences the dependent variable.  In a correlative experiment, the independent variable is not manipulated.  In an experiment intended to establish causality, the independent variable is either elevated or reduced to test for sufficiency or requirement, respectively.  When changes in the independent variable result in similar changes in the dependent variable, there is a promoting connection between the two variables.  When changes in the independent variable result in opposite changes in the dependent variable, there is an inhibitory connection between the two variables.

> Could just add in briefly here the importance of #Potential/Replication in supporting any conclusions drawn from the results

**Artificial Selection vs. Natural Selection**

Natural selection is the difference in survival and reproduction among the individuals that display variation in traits.  The individuals best suited for their environment will survive and reproduce, passing down the favorable traits to the next generation.  In artificial selection, during the breeding process, humans choose the individual with desirable traits to reproduce; this is sometimes also called domestication.  Both natural and artificial selection require the presence of heritable variation within a population.  The difference between the two is whether the difference in reproductive success is driven by natural environment or human desires.  Domesticated animals and plants have been selected for traits that are favored by humans instead of the natural environment.  Therefore, they are usually less fit to survive in the wild compared to their wild ancestors.

**Transposable Elements, Genome Stability, and Genetic Variation**

Transposable elements (TE) are DNA elements within the genome that have the ability to insert themselves into new chromosomal locations.  There are two type of TE’s.  Class I TEs transpose via an RNA intermediate while class II TEs transpose by cutting themselves from one location and inserting into another location in the genome.  In the process of transposition, TEs can cause chromosomal rearrangements, as well as alter gene expression and inserting into and around genes.  In some plants, TEs make up more than 50% of the genomic DNA.  Due to their high abundance in the genome, TEs have played a significant role in shaping the structure of the genome and in generating genetic diversity.  In maize, the regulatory region of the teosinte branched 1 (tb1) gene contains a Hopscotch transposable element, which causes tb1 to be expressed at a higher level and reduces the degree of branching.  The insertion of Hopscotch transposable element predates maize domestication by 10,000 years, which indicates that domestication acts on pre-existing genetic variations. 

**Meristem and Plant Architecture**

Plants grow by continuously forming new branches and leaves at regular intervals.  These organs are developed from a tissue called the meristem.  The cells within the meristem can divide rapidly to give rise to new organs.  The overall architecture of a plant is the result of two coordinated events: organ initiation and extension.  During organ initiation, the meristematic cells differentiate to form organ primordia.  The primordia then extend to form organs.  In plants, the lateral branches are derived from axillary meristems located in the axils of the leaves.  The degree of branching depends on whether these axillary meristems elongate to form branches.  For example, decreased branching is one of the major traits selected by farmers during the domestication of maize.  This trait is due to the over-expression of gene teosinte branched 1 (tb1) in maize, which inhibits the extension of axillary meristem.  The homologue of tb1 in Arabidopsis is called BRC1.  Loss-of-function brc1 mutant produces more axillary branches, indicating that the function of BRC1 is also to inhibit branching.  The expression level of BRC1 rises at high planting density, which causes the plant to produce fewer branches.  Therefore, BRC1 controls how environmental stimuli regulate plant architecture.


## Part I – Maize vs. Teosinte

Prior to coming to lab you will need to watch the video below and answer the following questions.  Videos and questions will take up to an hour to complete. 

Popped Secret: The Mysterious Origin of Corn (Running time: 17:51 minutes)
http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/popped-secret-mysterious-origin-corn

**Questions**

1. Corn (maize) was domesticated around 9,000 years ago through artificial selection.  The ancient farmers selectively planted kernels from those plants with desirable traits, such as bigger kernels, ease of harvest, and better taste.  During this time, the wild ancestor of maize, teosinte, has been under natural selection that favors those traits that improve the chance of survival and reproduction in the wild.

Maize and teosinte look different in many ways.  Assign the following pair of traits to their respective species by circling the correct response, then provide a hypothesis to explain why these traits were favored during natural selection.

**Trait 1: **

In (maize or teosinte), the seed is encased in a hard fruit case.  This trait may be favoured during (natural or artificial) selection because:


In (maize or teosinte), the seed is exposed.  This trait may be favoured during (natural or artificial) selection because:



**Trait 2: **

In (maize or teosinte), the plant has one main stalk.  This trait may be favoured during (natural or artificial) selection because:


In (maize or teosinte), the plant has many branches.  This trait may be favored during (natural or artificial) selection because:



**Trait 3: **

In (maize or teosinte), the ear breaks apart to release individual kernels at maturity.  This trait may be favoured during (natural or artificial) selection because:

In (maize or teosinte), the ear remains intact at maturity.  This trait may be favoured during (natural or artificial) selection because:



2. If both maize and teosinte are grown in the wild, which species is more likely to proliferate?  Why?

	a) Gain-of-function evidence:



	b) Loss-of-function evidence:




	c) Correlative evidence:

> Could also ask them why it was important to use multiple lines of evidence to support the #Concept/Hypothesis (Relates to #Potential/Replication and why #Potential/Reproducibility is important)


**At the beginning of lab,** get into a group of ~4 and answer the questions from Part I and II.  You will need to reach a consensus before submitting your group answers to your TA.

## Part III – Expression

With just one gene, a plant can change how it looks.  But why do plants need to change the way they look?  Unlike animals, plant growth and architecture are heavily influenced by the environment.  The ability to adjust the degree of branching can help the plant harvest the sunlight more efficiently.  In order to look at this in greater detail you and your group are going to analyze some data to see if the tb1 gene has similar functions in other plants.

**Questions**

1. The tb1 gene has a homologue in Arabidopsis called BRC1.  To test the function of this gene in Arabidopsis, a group of scientists conducted an experiment to measure the degree of branching in wild type plants and brc1 loss-of-function mutant plants.  Their data is presented in Figure 1.  What is the major conclusion in this experiment?  In your statement, please clearly identify the following

	a) The independent variable
	b) The dependent variable
	c) The type of evidence presented in this experiment
	d) How the dependent variable is influenced by the independent variable

> Since students have to interpret figures and results, this is a good place to introduce how to do a #Potential/Critical_analysis of research articles

2. To test whether the environment influences the number of branches formed, the scientists planted wild type plants and brc1 mutant plants at various planting densities, and measured the degree of branching in these plants.  Their data is presented in Figure 2.  What are the two major conclusions in this experiment?  In your statement please clearly identify the following:

	a) The independent variable
	b) The dependent variable
	c) The type of evidence presented in this experiment
	d) How the dependent variable is influenced by the independent variable.

Figure 2: The number of branches was measured in the brc1 loss-of-function mutant and the wild-type plants grown at different planting densities.

3. In wild-type Arabidopsis plants, is the expression of BRC1 more likely to increase or decrease when plants are planted at a lower density?  Why?


4. A common agricultural practice is to plant the crops at high density for the ease of irrigation and harvesting.  Therefore, reduced branching is a desirable trait during artificial selection.  Is artificial selection more likely to favour the BRC1 allele with a low expression level?  Why or why not?
