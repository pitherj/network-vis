# Lab 1 Introduction to Protists and Research Project

**For this week**

* Complete your in-class assignment
* Write down your TA’s name and contact information
* Find a partner and come up with a question for the term project. 

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

**At the end of this lab period, students should:**

*    Be familiar with the compound microscope and be able to use it properly

*   Know how to make a proper wet mount

*    Know the taxonomic groupings with the kingdom Protista

*    Know the basic features of eukaryotic cells

*    Know how to make a journal-style figure and calculate the scale of the figure

This lab begins with an introduction to the use of the compound microscope, one of the most important and widely used pieces of equipment in biology. You will then learn to make **wet-mount slides** and will use the microscope to become familiar with a group of simple eukaryotic organisms – the **protists**. Most protists you will see are single-celled organisms and are therefore useful models in the study of **the cell as a level of organization**. This group is taxonomically diverse; some of its older members were the origins of several important evolutionary branches and within this group are features shared by many eukaryotic cells.

## The Microscope

The microscopes you will be using are expensive precision instruments. To give you some idea of how much they can magnify an object, consider that the unaided eye can resolve objects about 0.1 mm in diameter. The best light microscope can resolve objects about 0.0002 mm (0.2ìm), about 500 times smaller than what you can see unaided.


Review the names and functions of the parts of a light microscope (Figure 1). Most of these features will be found on any standard microscope: the **base** and **arm**, revolving **nosepiece**, and **stage**. At the top are two removable **oculars** “eyepiece lenses**”** that magnify 10x. On the nosepiece are four **objective** **lenses** with powers of 4x, 10x, 40x and 100x. The 100x is an **oil** **immersion** **lens** for use with oil rather than air. We will not be using the oil immersion lens in this course. Note that some of the lenses have **retractable** **ends**. Which ones? Why? 


Focusing on an object is accomplished by raising or lowering the stage using **coarse** and **fine adjustment knobs**. Once an object is in focus under one lens it should be in focus, or nearly so, under the other objectives if the lenses are **parfocal**.


The light source in the **base** is controlled by a **rheostat**. Light is focused through a **condenser** which contains an **iris** **diaphragm** for adjusting the diameter of the cone of light passing upward. Also, on the condenser is a blue filter and some adjusting screws for aligning the light with the objective lens - DO NOT touch them. Call for help if you feel they need adjustment.

Slides are held in place by a **spring clamp** and moved by the **coaxial** **drive** on the stage

**Caring for your microscope**:

1. Handle with great care. Carry the microscope in an upright position with one hand on the arm and the other to support the base.

2. Never use force to move any part of the microscope. 

3. Be very cautious when raising the stage with the coarse adjustment knob. Watch from the side while doing this. It is best to focus by moving the stage **away** from (not to) the slide.

4. Do not touch the lenses with anything but lens paper. 

5. Report any damage to the microscopes or slides immediately. 

**You will be assigned a microscope with a particular number to use for the term. Please return your microscope to the appropriate location in the metal cupboards when you are finished using it. Ensure that the cord is neatly wound around the base, the 4x objective lens is in the working position and that you place the microscope into the cupboard with the ocular lenses facing toward the back. You will also be assigned a specific slide box for use throughout the term. Please return the slides to the proper numbered slot in the box and in the proper orientation after you use them.**


**Turn the microscope on, obtain a prepared slide, and practice making these adjustments:**

1.  Set the distance between the eyepieces (**oculars**) to suit your eyes. You should be able to see one full circle, not two overlapping circles. Your eyes should be just close enough to the lenses so that the circle doesn’t wobble. Don’t touch the lenses with your eyes. 

2.  Move the lowest power **objective** (the shortest one) into place over the slide (it will click slightly). This is the 4X objective and should have a 4 printed on it. Lower the stage so you have room to place a slide onto it without damaging the lens.

3.  Place a slide onto the **stage** and secure it with the **spring clamp**. Move it, using the **coaxial drive**, such that the object (specimen) is centered over the **aperture** (hole) in the middle of the stage and light is shining through it. **Watching from the side**, move the stage up slowly so that the slide is a few millimetres from the lens. Be very careful that they don’t touch.

4.  Look through the oculars and focus on the object by slowly **moving the stage away from the lens** using the coarse focus knob first, then the fine focus knob. If you don’t see anything at this point, call your instructor for help. 

5.  Practice using the fine focus and switching between objectives (except the oil immersion objective). When you switch objectives, watch from the side to be sure it doesn’t scratch the lens. Be very careful when using the 40X objective. When you are comfortable, focus on part of the object using the 10X objective and continue with step 6.

6.  Adjust the light - three controls are involved:

	a) **Rheostat**. In general, higher magnification requires greater light intensity, so you may need to turn this up or down depending on the specimen you are viewing.

	b) **Condenser** height. This should be adjusted to give the greatest clarity. As a rule, the condenser should be left at the highest position. Moving this is for experts.

	c) **Iris diaphragm**. Each time you switch objectives, the diameter of the light circle should be adjusted so as to give the **sharpest resolution** by moving the small lever on the side of the condenser. The iris diaphragm is equivalent to the aperture in standard cameras. As a rule, it should be opened wider as the magnification increases. For prepared slides, it should be almost wide open for the 40X objective and almost closed for the 4X objective. With very transparent objects you may want to close it down even on high power. With transparent objects in water, such as the protists you will be viewing later, you will need to pay close attention to this setting. 

7.  Adjust the focus independently for left and right eyes. (1) Focus sharply on some part of the object with your *right* eye (**left eye closed**) using the focus knobs. (2) Now **close your right eye** and focus the left ocular for your *left* eye by rotating the left adjustable ocular until the focus is sharp (keep your hands off the fine focus). Now open both eyes. You can fine-tune these adjustments, but both eyes should now see a focussed object in the center of one circle of light. Don’t despair, this takes a bit of practice to achieve.


8.  Try relocating parts of objects using the **verniers**, adjusting light to suit various objective lenses and focusing up and down through the object to get a feel for the depth of focus for each lens. Which objective has the greatest depth of focus? Can you tell which parts of the object are "on top?"


You should compare the compound microscopes to the lower-powered dissection (stereo) microscope on display. You won’t be using them today but you will in later lab sessions. Use Figure 2 to learn the parts of a dissection microscope.

![img](../images/microscope-2.png)


Dissection microscopes have one or two objective lenses with limited ranges. Some have zoom. Notice that this instrument has a lower magnification, provides greater depth of field and can use reflected light. The compound microscope you have been using can use only transmitted light. You may use **transmitted light** for some objects (by shining light through them), but dissection microscopes are best for viewing large, opaque objects with **reflected light**.


**Fields of view and magnification:**

Each objective lens allows you to see a circular area of the slide. As you increase magnification, the amount of the slide you can see gets smaller and smaller. In other words, as you go up in magnification, the area you see in the circle is a smaller area of the slide. We call this viewing circle the “**field of view**”. Each lens has a known **field of view diameter** that is expressed in mm and is given to you (you don’t have to memorize them for tests). 

Since you know the diameter of the field of view for each lens, you can easily estimate the length or size of objects you are looking at by roughly comparing the object’s size to the diameter of the circle. For example, suppose you are looking at a protozoan that extends 3/4 of the way across the field under 400X total magnification. The diameter of the field of view for the 40X objective is 0.4mm; therefore, the length of the organism is 0.3mm. 

See Figure 3 for the field of view diameters for our lenses.

![img](../images/microscope-3.png)


The magnification of an object, as your eyes see it through a microscope, is simply the power of the ocular times the power of the objective lens. So, with a 10X ocular and a 40X objective, you are seeing the object magnified 400X. This is called the **total (viewing) magnification**. The magnification or scale of a drawing however is different thing. It is a measure of how many times bigger your drawing is relative to the size of the object. If you make a large drawing, the magnification will be greater than if you make a small drawing. 

**The formula for determining drawing magnification is:**

Magnification (or scale) of Drawing = size of drawing / size of object


Estimate the size of the object first, by using the diameter of the **field of view** as a "yardstick", the way we described above. Then measure your drawing. If the protozoan from the above example in your drawing is 6 cm long then the magnification of the drawing is 200X (watch your units). 

* Length of object is about ¾ of 0.4mm = 0.3mm
* Length of object in the drawing = 6cm = 60mm
* Magnification of object in the drawing = 60mm/0.3mm = 200X.


Note that units must match and then they cancel out, leaving the “X” to indicate magnification. You may also use the word “times” instead of “X”. Normally this is included in figure captions or at the bottom of a diagram.


You should also practice using the lower-powered dissecting (stereo) microscope (see Fig. 2). Notice that this instrument, while giving lower magnification, provides greater depth of field and can use reflected light. The compound microscope you have been using up until now can only use transmitted light. What kinds of objects are best viewed under the dissecting scope?

Once you are comfortable with the microscopes, use them to study the protists. This will begin your study of the diversity of life that will continue throughout this semester. It will also test your ability to use the microscopes properly.

## Protists

All eukaryotic organisms that are not classified as plants, animals, or fungi are lumped together in a single large taxonomic group and referred to as the **protists.** Included in this group are algae and protozoa as well as colonial and multinucleate slime molds. Within a few years this taxonomy will likely change as we learn more about these groups. As you will notice protists are quite diverse, both structurally and metabolically. With the advent of DNA sequencing, their taxonomy is under intense review with up to 12 kingdoms being proposed. Refer to your text for a discussion of modern research in protist systematics. We will be using single-celled organisms from these groups to learn about basic cell structure, as well as a little taxonomy. You will be looking at a number of prepared slides of protists and also making wet mounts of living protists. Please dispose of the slides used for the wet mounts in the appropriate container for glass waste.

### A. Amoeba group {-}

Members of this group use **pseudopodia** (cytoplasmic extensions that form false feet) for locomotion and feeding. The most common type is the freshwater amoeba (Figure 4) whose "body" constantly changes shape as new pseudopodia are formed and old ones retract. These amoebae will move toward a food source by extending a pseudopodium, then flowing into it. Other members of this group, such as foraminiferans and the radiolarians, have a more fixed shape due to the hard calcareous or siliceous **tests** (shells) that they produce. They have slender pseudopodia that extend through fine holes in the test. When pseudopodia are used for feeding, food particles or prey are engulfed by the pseudopodia and **phagocytized**. 


![img](../images/Fig-4.jpg) 

Figure 4. *Amoeba*.

![img](../images/AmoebaHugs.jpg)


1.  Take an amoeba from the jar on the lab bench (your instructor will show you how) and put it on a depression slide. Place a coverslip on it very carefully or it may be crushed. You may also view them without using a coverslip but only with the 4X and 10X objectives. Closing down the iris diaphragm will give you a greater depth of field. Look for a large **nucleus** and smaller solid bodies, which are **food vacuoles**. If you see a round, clear body rapidly forming and disappearing, you are seeing a **contractile vacuole**. *Amoeba* and many other freshwater protists constantly and unavoidably gain water by osmosis. Contractile vacuoles pump out this excess water to maintain homeostasis. You may notice a difference in the fluidity of the cytoplasm in peripheral areas compared to the interior of the cell. The outer **ectoplasm** is more rigid and provides shape to the amoeba; the inner **endoplasm** is more fluid. Dispose of the coverslip in the glass garbage container and place the slide in the beaker of bleach.


2.  Look at one of the prepared slides of **foraminiferans (Slide 1)**. All you will be able to see are the **calcareous** **tests** perforated with tiny pores. Note that the tests are multichambered (see Figure 5). As a “foram” grows, it secretes a larger chamber that remains attached to the older smaller chambers. Thread-like pseudopodia in living forams extend through the fine pores.

![img](../images/Fig-5.jpg) 

Figure 5. Foraminifera.

3.  Look at the prepared slide of **radiolarians (Slide #2)**. Their tests are commonly made of **silica.** The complete and fragmented tests of many different species are visible. Again, note the fine pores for pseudopodia. Foraminiferans and radiolarians are both primarily marine organisms and make up a significant portion of the sea bed. See Figure 6 for some images of radiolaria.

![img](../images/Fig-6.jpg)

Figure 6. Radiolaria. 

### B. Flagellate group {-}

This group is descended from the ancestor to all modern multicellular plants and animals. Members of this group use **flagella** for locomotion and many are photosynthetic. Often the green colour of a pond is due to millions of *Euglena*. 

1.  Place a drop of living *Euglena* on a regular slide and put a coverslip over the drop. Start with low power, but if you use high power (400x total magnification) you should see the red **eyespot** and a **flagellum**. Closing down the diaphragm will help. See Figure 7. Discard this slide and coverslip in the glass garbage container.

![img](../images/Fig-7.jpg)

Figure 7. *Euglena.*


2.  Observe *Volvox*, a colonial organism (use a depression slide to avoid crushing it). The colony is a large hollow ball of cells with each one connected to its neighbours by cytoplasmic strands. The individual cells each have their own pair of flagella, which can be seen if you look carefully at the edge of the ball. The flagella of all the cells beat together in a coordinated fashion allowing directed motion. Smaller **daughter colonies** can usually be seen inside a larger colony. See Figure 8 for a photograph of a *Volvox* colony. Discard the coverslip and place this slide in the beaker of bleach.

![img](../images/Fig-8.jpg)


Figure 8. *Volvox* colony.

### C. Ciliate group {-} 

This is a large and very diverse group whose members use **cilia** for locomotion. Most have a tough outer **pellicle** (a flexible test), an **oral groove** (a funnel-shaped area that acts like a mouth), food and storage **vacuoles** and an **anal pore**, or cytopyge, where wastes are released from vacuoles. Ciliates have two types of nuclei - a large **macronucleus** involved with metabolic processes and one or more **micronuclei** which function primarily in sexual reproduction. 


1.  Use a regular slide to make a wet mount of a living *Paramecium* and identify the beating **cilia**, the **pellicle**, the **oral groove**, **contractile vacuoles** (used to expel water) and two types of **nuclei**. You may also observe the prepared slides (Slide #3) if the living ones are moving too fast. Figure 9 is a photograph of a prepared paramecium slide.

![img](../images/Fig-9.jpg) 

Figure 9. *Paramecium*.       

2.  Another interesting ciliate is *Vorticella*. This organism usually attaches by a stalk to a piece of debris. Use a pipette to transfer debris to a regular slide and gently add a coverslip. Focus on the debris, increase the total magnification to 100X and look for a goblet-shaped organism attached to the substrate by a **contractile stalk** (Figure 10). When disturbed the stalk shortens with a sudden jerk, serving as an escape response. At the other end you can observe a ring of cilia that creates the current that brings food particles into the organism. Identify the **cilia**, the **pellicle**, the **oral groove**, **contractile vacuoles** (used to expel water) and the large **macronucleus**. Discard this slide in the glass garbage container.
![img](../images/Fig-10.jpg)

Figure 10 – *Vorticella*

3.  If a culture of *Stentor* is available, look for one of these beautiful blue-green ciliates (Figure 11). They may be large enough to be seen with the naked eye! Use a depression slide and do NOT use a coverslip until you are sure you are able to use one without squashing the poor creatures. These ciliates can change their shape extensively so they may appear as a ball or they may be vase-shaped. Where are the cilia? They are darkly pigmented so the internal features may be difficult to see but look for the large **macronucleus**, the **oral groove** and the **bands of cilia**. Place this slide in the beaker of bleach when you are finished. 

![img](../images/Fig-11.jpg)     

Figure 11. *Stentor*

### D. Diatom group {-}

Diatoms are photosynthetic protists with very distinctive cell walls embedded with silica. Their two-part cell walls are called **frustules** and often exhibit characteristic fine lines on their surfaces. They are extremely important photosynthetic producers in both marine and freshwater environments and contain an abundance of carotenoid pigments so they have a yellow-brown appearance (although they may be stained a different colour on a prepared slide). Diatoms have neither flagella nor cilia. Many are planktonic, but others move with a gliding motion thought to be achieved with the aid of mucus-like secretions. Look at the prepared slides of diatoms available and note the variety of beautiful siliceous **frustules** (Figure 12).

![img](../images/Fig-12.jpg)

Figure 12. Some common diatom shapes.

### Drawings {-}

In this lab course you will learn to make journal-style figures. They are slightly different than a simple drawing. Here are some simple rules for making journal-style figures:


*  Do not draw a circle around your drawing. This may have been required in high school but it is never included in journals or books.

* Use a clean, unlined 8.5" x 11" white sheet of paper for your drawing.

* Use a sharp, hard pencil only.

* Make your drawing **BIG**. It should be *at least* half the size of the paper.

* If possible, orient your drawing so that the anterior or dorsal aspect of the organism (if it has one) is at the top of the page. This is merely a convention.

* Locate the drawing so that the labels can be put in a column on one side (usually the right) of the page. Draw straight label lines that do not cross each other.

* Use a minimum number of fine lines and use dotted lines to show depth. Do not shade.

* **Do not put a “title” at the top** of your drawing. Instead, treat your drawing as a “figure” and place a **figure caption** at the bottom left side of your drawing. Figure captions can be several sentences long and adequately describe what the figure is.

* Be sure to underline (*or italicize*) genus and species names. The first letter of the genus name should be capitalized. Do not capitalize the species name. This kind of spelling counts.

* Put the scale of your drawing in brackets in your figure legend.

* Put your name, section number, and date in the upper right corner of your drawing. Note that this is not normally part of a figure, but we need to keep track of your papers somehow.


Labelling should be as complete as possible. (#_msocom_1)  If any structures have been removed or displaced you should indicate this on your drawing. If the manual or text mentions certain structures that you cannot locate, the wisest procedure would be to make a note to this effect on your drawing. For example, you may say “nuclei not seen” in your caption. Finally, be sure your drawing is done from the material you are studying. Drawings taken from books or manuals are not acceptable. 

> Making sure the labelling is as complete as possible: Connection to the role of #Concept/Metadata in #Concept/Reproducibility and results interpretation (risk of #Concept/Bias through non-disclosure of details)

## Assignment

**To be handed in before you leave**

* Your TA will choose one of the protists you have viewed in the lab and you will make a drawing of it as a **formal journal-style figure** to be handed in before you leave the lab. 

* Calculate the scale of your drawing and include magnification in the caption or at the bottom of the figure. 

* Show your work for calculating magnification and scale on the back of the page. These calculations would not be part of a proper journal figure but we want to be able to check them.

> Could refer students to the #Potential/Biology_data_presentation_guidelines doc for how to do a proper figure caption

HINTS: Keep the drawing simple but try to identify some parts of the organism with the help of your text and lab reference books. If you are uncertain about some structures, put a question mark after the label. 

### Rubric {-}

![](../images/rubric.jpg)

## Research Project

**Over this term, your lab periods will be spent designing and conducting an experiment, and analysing and presenting your results. The research project will be done in groups of 2 students (3 if uneven numbers)**

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

Students will participate in the process of science and demonstrate scientific thinking. Students will be introduced to the characteristics of the experimental method of research and learn:

* How to form a hypothesis.

* How to design an experiment to test your hypothesis.

* How to analyse and display your results.

* How to interpret your results so as to support or reject your hypothesis.

* How to present your results as an oral presentation.

(Parts of this manual have been copied and modified with permission from the Biology 140 manual at UBC Vancouver.)

 > Could incorporate/emphasize #Potential/Open_science practices generally here as a learning outcome

### SCIENTIFIC METHOD {-}

Until the age of enlightenment humankind had no reliable mechanism for determining which of the many possible explanations for natural processes the correct ones were. People tried a variety of ways to make sense of their observations but, until the development of the scientific method, there was no method for separating fact from fallacy in a reliable way

> Opportunity for addressing ways of knowing addressing partnership research as an aspect of  #Potential/Open_science

Over the last 200 years scientists have refined and expanded rules and methods that, if followed correctly, allow researchers to collect and analyze data in a way that allows them to reliably and accurately describe nature. The scientific process today includes many methodologies for testing ideas and analyzing data that eliminate human bias and reveal the truth about natural processes. 


Some scientists are interested in measuring and recording observations in nature. This is sometimes called “descriptive science”. Scientific sampling and collection methods allow researchers to describe nature accurately. We can then use these observations to make generalization’s about the world using “deductive logic”. 


Other scientists wonder why things are the way they are. They form ideas, or hypotheses using “inductive logic” about how things must work and then test these ideas using what is called the “scientific method”. The scientific method includes several steps that allow researchers to make the best hypotheses, design the best tests and run the best experiments possible.

 > Could bring in the importance of #Potential/Reproducibility in science ie. only through replication ( #Potential/Replicability )of studies in various ways can we be confident that results truly reflect "facts of nature". Additionally emphasizing using proper methods while conducting research ie. taking detailed notes of steps completed, using #Potential/Version_control, #Potential/aPriori_hypothesis etc. and how that enhances #Potential/Reproducibility

If all the rules are followed correctly, then human bias will be eliminated and the facts of nature will be revealed. Many times, over, science has turned our preconceived ideas upside down but other times it has confirmed that what we predicted was, in fact true. The point is, without the rules of science, humans are not capable of sorting truth from fiction using observations alone. 


Scientists do not accept anything on faith. Science is not a belief system; scientists are convinced only by evidence and data. Any idea is up for debate and everything can be criticized. It takes many years and many experiments to convince scientists that something is true or not true. For example, the idea that the continental plates are moving slowly over the surface of the Earth took decades to take root. It was debated and tested and tested again by many people before it was fully accepted. This is as it should be. We don’t accept any explanation as “true” before every other possible explanation has been tested and rejected. The last idea standing is the one that we accept as the best one; until a better explanation comes along.

### The Experimental Method {-}

As with all approaches of the scientific method, the experimental method has several major steps, which are:

**1)   Observation of phenomena and formation of a question.**

The first step in any research is to decide on a *"problem"* or focus for the investigation. This often happens when you observe something that interests you. This will form a "question", such as "why did it do that?" This is the first task you and your group members must determine. The question you ask must be informed by existing knowledge and relevant research.


You may consider using organisms such as sea monkeys or Daphnia, meal worms, germinating seeds, plants or humans for your research project. Your research question must include the effect of “x” on some physiological parameter such as survival, some aspect of behaviour, growth, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, some aspect of vision or colour vision, or some aspect of hearing. 

**2)   Statement of hypothesis.**

> Connects to #Concept/Hypothesis; Could emphasize the importance of #Potential/aPriori_hypothesis and not #Potential/HARKing

A hypothesis is an unproved conclusion or explanation for the observed phenomena. In its simplest form, a hypothesis is a "guess" or intuitive hunch that is proposed as a tentative answer to a problem or question. Any good hypothesis must meet several criteria. The hypothesis must be "**testable**". The hypothesis does not need to be "correct", but you have to be able to test whether it is correct or not. In the experimental method, you perform experiments in order to gather information to show whether or not your hypothesis is correct. A second criterion is that a good hypothesis must be based on **measurable, describable facts.** A hypothesis is written as a statement that can be supported or rejected on the basis of the experimental results. Two hypotheses are stated at the same time: the null hypothesis (Ho) which states that the factor being tested will have no effect on the outcome (i.e. there will be no difference) and an alternate hypothesis (Ha) which states that the factor being tested will have an effect on the outcome. The data that you generate needs to be analysed by some statistical test which will either allow you to reject your null hypothesis or fail to reject your null hypothesis. Experiments cannot prove that your alternate hypothesis is true; they can only offer evidence to support it. 

 > This needs some tweaking, including adding statement about failure to reject null does not mean null is true (e.g. #Potential/Study_power issues).  Need to state that well-designed experiments can establish cause and effect.

**3)   Design of an experiment and the gathering of data to test the hypothesis.**

Once the initial hypothesis has been stated, you then design experiments to gather data that when analysed, will either support or falsify your hypothesis. An experiment is a procedure designed to describe the factors, in a given situation, that affect one another under certain conditions. Ideally experiments should be conducted in such a way that the experimenter has control over every **variable.** A variable is any factor that might affect the outcome of the experiment. The experimenter therefore manipulates the "**independent variable**" and observes the effects of this manipulation on the "**dependent** (or **response**) **variable**". For example, if the goal is to determine the effects of **temperature** on the **growth rate** of a plant, then **growth rate** is the dependent variable because it "depends" on the **temperature** to which the plant is exposed. All other variable must be controlled or held constant. **Temperature** is the independent variable because that is the variable which is manipulated by the experimenter. The ideal way to perform such an experiment is to set up and run a series of tests that are all identical, except for the one specific factor that is varied.


One specimen (or group of specimens) is used as a **control** against which all other experimental samples are compared. **The importance of the control group cannot be over emphasized.** It is essential to know how the system you are investigating works under normal circumstances, before you can be sure the results obtained from the experimentation are actually due to the manipulation of the independent variable(s). To continue our example above, if you wanted to investigate the effects of temperature (the independent variable) on the growth rate of a plant (the dependent variable), you would gather data on the growth rate of plants at "normal" room temperature (the control group), and compare this data to the growth rates of plants exposed to higher and lower temperatures. The control group would provide the "normal standard" against which all other samples would be compared.

 Another important rule governing experimentation is that the experiments must be done on a large number of subjects. The larger the "sample size" or the more replicates you include, the more confident you would be in your results. 

 > This relates to statistical power aka #Concept/Study_power

Every treatment in your experiment (including the control) must have replicates. Sometimes very large sample sizes are just not possible. In our example above if you were growing your plants in the front window, you may have room for only five or six. However, if you had a greenhouse, you could grow and measure hundreds of plants.

Biological variation is the inherent differences among organisms in a sample because of differences in genetic makeup, age, sex, health, etc. Biological variation is difficult to avoid but can be decreased by limiting the characteristics of the group of organisms you are studying (e.g., by using organisms of the same age, sex, etc.

> Suggest adding: Even then, it is crucial that subjects be randomly assigned ( #Potential/Random_assignment ) to the treatment groups, so that any inherent variation among individuals will be distributed at random among all treatments, including the control group.

Lastly, the experiment should be "**repeatable**". That is, others should be able to follow the same experimental procedure, and come up with similar results. If they don’t then maybe there is an extraneous variable you missed.

> Absolutely can emphasize #Potential/Open_science best practices here and things the students can do to ensure #Concept/Reproducibility of their results. Not just for others to be able to repeat the experiment but for them to be able to as well.

> Delete last sentence and replace with: Then maybe some details of the experiment were not sufficiently well described, or maybe the treatment effects are simply not strong enough to be repeatable given the experimental design.

**4)   Analyse the results of the experiment and graphically represent the results**

Often the final data presented are converted from the original measurements (raw data), to some other form. This may mean that averaging or some other statistical treatment must be applied, or some conversion from one kind of unit to another be made. Often graphs will be useful in displaying the data. To return to our example above, the raw data may simply be the heights of the plants you measured each day, recorded in cm. The final data on growth rate are then calculated and expressed as the average increase in height per day, of all the plants measured, in each temperature group.

In order to interpret the results, there are really only two bits of information you need. The first is some estimate of the "central tendency" in the response. That is, what was the "average" response of all the organisms measured? In our example, if you had ten plants in one temperature group, say 10o C, you could calculate the "**arithmetic average**", or the **"mean"** growth rate by adding up the growth rates of all ten plants in that group and dividing the total by ten. There are other estimates of the "central tendency" that may, in some cases, be more informative. One is the "**median**". This is the value that divides the number of observations into two equal groups. The other estimate of central tendency is the "**mode**". It is used most often in business statistics, and is the value of the observation that occurs most often.

The other bit of information you will need in order to interpret your results is some estimate of the "**variation of the response within the group**". For example, say the mean growth rate of our plants, at 25o C, was 3.0 cm per day. It is important to know whether six of the plants grew at a rate of 3.0 cm per day, and two grew at a rate of 2.0 cm per day, and two grew at a rate of 4.0 cm per day, in which case there was very little difference (variation) in their responses to that temperature, or whether two of the plants grew at a rate of 11.0 cm per day, and the other eight grew at a rate of only 1.0 cm per day, in which case there is a very great difference in the responses of these plants to that temperature. 

Due to the nature of biological organisms, no two will respond in exactly the same way to any given independent variable. It is important then to have some estimate of this variation in response. There are several ways to estimate this variation. One is to simply state the "**range**" of the responses. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values obtained. There are much more mathematically involved estimates of variation in response, such as "**standard deviation**". One should not be intimidated by the mathematics of the calculation of standard deviation, but simply realize that it's just another estimate of variation in response. 

Our experimental design determines what type of data you collect which then determines how that data can be analysed. Data that are continuous are analysed with measures of central tendency and variation (explained further below). Examples of continuous data are rates, weights, time, distances, etc as generated by **measured-response experiments** such as the plant experiment described above. Data that are discrete are recorded as frequencies of observations and are analysed using a Chi-squared (X2) test. **Choice experiments** that generate discrete data record the frequency of selection of habitat, light, etc. For example, if mice were presented with two different bedding materials, the data collected would be discrete. You will use one of the following two methods of analysis for your own experimental results; the one you use will depend on the nature of the data you collect.

**Measured-response experiments – mean, variance, standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals**

After calculating the mean of each treatment, you can compare the means to see which, if any, treatments result in a significant difference in response. The first step in comparing means is to determine how close all the data points in each data set are to each other. Two statistics are used to describe the variation in a data set; variance and standard deviation. 

**Variance (s2)** is a measure of how much the data values scatter around the mean. A small variance indicates the data are tightly clustered around the mean. The larger the variance, the more scattered the data. Variance is calculated by summing all the squared deviations from the mean (a deviation is the difference between an individual measurement and the mean) and dividing this sum by the number of data entries minus one. 

s2 =  ∑ (xi – x)2

n-1


Variance values should be reported to the same number of decimal places as the data entries contain.

> Refer to the #Potential/Biology_data_presentation_guidelines here because it's actually 1 extra decimal place for measures of variance

**Standard deviation (s)** is a related statistic that is the square root of the variance.

Standard deviation can be determined on calculators or in Excel 

> #Potential/RLanguage

but it is important that you understand how it is calculated and what it represents. The formula for calculating standard deviation (s) is shown below.

Let’s calculate the standard deviations of the two samples of plant described above with the same average daily growth rates of 3cm/day. Complete the table below to find the standard deviations for each sample population.


| **Plants**           | **Sample population 1**    | **Sample population 2** |           |                            |        |            |

| **2**                | 3                          | 0                       | 0         | 11                         | 8      | 64         |
| **3**                | 3                          | 0                       | 0         | 1                          | -2     | 4          |
| **4**                | 3                          | 0                       | 0         | 1                          | -2     | 4          |

| **6**                | 3                          | 0                       | 0         | 1                          | -2     | 4          |
| **7**                | 2                          | -1                      | 1         | 1                          | -2     | 4          |
| **8**                | 2                          | -1                      | 1         | 1                          | -2     | 4          |
| **9**                | 4                          | 1                       | 1         | 1                          | -2     | 4          |
| **10**               | 4                          | 1                       | 1         | 1                          | -2     | 4          |
| **Mean growth rate** | 3  cm/day                  |                         |           | 3  cm/day                  |        |            |
|                      |                            |                         | Sum = 4   |                            |        | Sum =  160 |


For Sample population 1, the sum of (x-x2) = 4; whereas for sample population 2, the sum of (x-x2) = 160. For both populations, n-1 = 9. 

Therefore, for sample population 1;      

​                           s= √4/9 = 0.66

and for sample population 2;

​                           s= √160/9 = 4.22

 

What does this tell you? A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the [mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean), whereas a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values.

**95% Confidence Interval**

The mean and standard deviation are statistics that describe the data points in a sample. As such, they are estimates of the true mean and standard deviation of the entire population. We can then use these estimates to calculate an interval or range of values within which the mean of the entire population (true mean) will likely fall. The size of this range indicates the confidence with which we can say the true mean will fall within these limits. By calculating a 95% confidence interval, we can say that 95% of the time, the true mean will lie within this range; this is the level of confidence most biologists use. 

> Not quite right, rather: "We are 95% confident that the true mean lies within this range". Or "On average, we can expect the true mean to lie in this range 95% of the time" Relates to #Skill/Confidence_interval.

The formula for calculating the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean is:

CI = x + 1.96 s

​             √n

> NOTE: this should be introduced as a rule of thumb CI, because the 1.96 should actually be replaced by a value of "t" corresponding to appropriate degrees of freedom etc... #Skill/Confidence_interval

Where s is the standard deviation and n is the sample size. 95% confidence intervals allow us to determine, with a 5% chance of error, whether the differences between two or more samples are due to random chance or sampling error, or due to some real difference in the characteristics of the samples and therefore the entire population of measurements. Most biologists use this 5% probability level to determine if there are significant differences in the means from different treatment groups in their experiments. This roughly translates to an acceptable risk of 5% or 5 times in 100 of drawing the wrong conclusion about the population from the sample data. 


If the 95% confidence intervals of any sample means do not overlap, we can be 95% confident that the samples are not from the same population of measurements. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between these samples and provide support for the alternate hypothesis that these is a significant difference between samples.


If the 95% confidence intervals of all sample means **do overlap** then we are less than 95% confident that the samples are from different populations of measurements. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis as this is insufficient evidence to determine if the samples are from different populations of measurements. When the 95% confidence intervals overlap, discrepancies between sample means can be attributed to random chance, error and variation rather than significant differences between the means of the samples. 


**Graphing your data**

> Need to find (or make) is a shiny app that allows them to enter data and it'll do calculations and plotting but also show the R code alongside. For #Skill/Data_visualization in #Potential/RLanguage 

Finally, it is often very useful to display the data/results in the form of a graph. Simple "**line graphs**" allow the relationships (trends or patterns) within the data to be visualised by the reader at a glance. Line graphs are often used to display "**continuous data**", or measurements made on the same subjects over time. In our example, the mean heights of the plants growing at 25oC could be recorded each day and plotted as a line graph (Figure1). From this type of graph, it is easy to tell whether the plants grew at the same rate throughout the course of the experiment, or whether they grew more quickly when they were young seedlings. Line graphs are generally best for data attained from measured-response experiments. 

![](../images/graph.jpg)    

Figure 1: The effect of time on mean plant height (mm) for plants grown at 25oC.

A "**bar graph**", seen in Figure 2, is useful if you wish to display "**discrete data**", such as the average maximum growth rate of our plants with respect to temperature. Bar graphs are generally best for data attained from choice experiments.

> CORRECTION: this is not an example of discrete data... so bar graph inappropriate.

Regardless of the type of graph used, the independent variable (i.e. temperature in this example) is always placed on the horizontal (or X) axis and the dependent variable (i.e. growth rate) appears on the vertical (or Y) axis. All figures must have a number (and be numbered sequentially) and a detailed title that are placed below the figure.

 ![](../images/graph-2.jpg)

**Interpretation of results, and drawing conclusions.**

This final step requires that you provide a straightforward description of the conclusions drawn from your results. Do these sample means represent different populations of measurement (i.e. do you reject Ho)? Or, do the sample means represent the same population of measurements (i.e. do you fail to reject Ho)? Do the confidence intervals overlap or did you find a significant Chi squared value?


If your data allow you to reject Ho and provide support for Ha then you need to explain the specific effect the factor had on your organism and the processes that occurred to result in this response. Does this agree with your prediction? If not, why not? 


When possible, your findings should be compared to those of other investigators working on the same problem. It is important to realise that scientific investigations do not always yield the anticipated results. If there are discrepancies between your results and those of others, or what you expected to find based on your readings, this is the place to try and explain those discrepancies.

> An opportunity to highlight #Concept/Reproducibility

All information obtained from other sources or any ideas that are not your own, must be properly cited in the body of your poster presentation and included in a “Literature Cited” or “References” list at the end.

## Citing Literature

In your written work, every time you mention an item of information or any idea that is not your own, the source must be credited in the text. This refers to published material but can also include personal communications from colleagues and professors. In science, avoid using quotations and footnotes wherever possible. Do not copy *verbatim* from your sources; rephrase the material into your own words and acknowledge the source using one of the formats described below. If you must copy a sentence or two, then use quotation marks. While many different formats exist for citing literature, for the purposes of this project APA reference style is to be followed.

> link to the Library APA style guide or an example of a proper citation.
> There's a lot of room to build this section out that support OS - such as the need to connect research outputs that build the evidence base. The library also already has Canvas modules addressing a lot of this with specific modules for APA as well as an online guide with examples. In theory this is hit in first year English, but that's not always taken in first year.
