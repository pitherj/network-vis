## INTRODUCTION

Before we proceed we need first to understand visible radiation and consider what is colour? White (or visible) light includes light between about 400 and 710 nm. Wavelengths of light less than 400 nm include UV and X-rays, while wavelengths longer than 710 nm include infrared, microwaves and radio waves. Within the visible light spectrum, we perceive different colours at different wavelengths of light (400 nm; purple, 450-550 nm; blue and green, 550-650 nm; yellow to orange and 650-700 nm; red). See the illustration in your text of the electromagnetic spectrum. The colour of an object is seen when white light is shone upon the object's surface. The surface reflects some colours and absorbs others. It is the reflected wavelength of light that is picked up by the eye. For example, a cherry is reflecting red light and absorbing other colours therefore we perceive the cherry as red in colour. The perception of colour is a sensory experience that involves sensory receptors called rods and cones present in the retina of the eye, and specific regions of the brain. Different wavelengths of light stimulate different patterns of sensory receptors in the retina and subsequently, the brain interprets the pattern of signals as different colours.

### Part I: SPECTROPHOTOMETRY

Make sure that you are familiar with the different colours that result from different wavelengths of light within the visible light spectrum. A spectrophotometer shines a beam of light of a particular wavelength through a sample in a cuvette, and records either the amount of light that did not come through the sample (i.e. the amount of light absorbed by the sample) or the amount of light that did come through the sample (i.e. the amount of light transmitted). You will construct absorption spectra for 2 samples made with food colouring and water; one red and one blue. 

Equipment per group:

* 1 spectrophotometer				
* 3 cuvettes:	
	* 1 cuvette as a blank, containing distilled water only
	* 1 cuvette with a red solution				
    * 1 cuvette with water with a blue solution			 
* test tube rack or beaker				
* Kimwipes for cleaning the cuvettes 

Turn the spectrophotometer on and let it warm up. The operating instructions for the spectrophotometer are located beside each machine. 

**There is a short instructional video entitled ‘How to use a spectrophotometer” posted on Canvas. Please watch this prior to your lab.**

The cuvettes must be just about full to ensure that the beam of light will pass through the sample not just through the glass of the cuvette. 

1. Begin with a wavelength of 400 nm and set the Mode on the spectrophotometer to 0-2A. (What does "A" mean?)

2. Carefully follow the instructions beside the spectrophotometer to zero the spectrophotometer. The blank corrects for any absorbance the water may have at each wavelength. **Make sure you understand the purpose of the blank.**

3. Remove the blank and insert the cuvette containing the red food colouring. Record the absorbance. Remove that cuvette and insert the cuvette containing the blue food colouring and again record the absorbance value. 

4. Repeat this process at 20 nm intervals up to 700 nm, recording your data in Table 1. **Remember, you must zero the spectrophotometer with the blank for each wavelength.** 

5. Construct a graph (an absorption spectrum), with wavelength as the independent variable. Be sure your graph is properly labelled and has an appropriate figure title and caption.

### Part II: INTRODUCTION TO PHOTOSYNTHESIS

**Photosynthesis** is the process that plants and other organisms use to transform the energy of light (photons) into the energy stored in the chemical bonds of sugars. Light-sensitive pigments absorb this energy and pass energized electrons along to electron transport chains that generate ATP and NADPH. The energy and reducing power contained in these two chemicals is ultimately used to make glucose. Chlorophyll *a* is the primary light-absorbing pigment found in plants. Additional **accessory pigments** such as chlorophyll *b*, carotenoids, and xanthophylls absorb light at wavelengths not well absorbed by chlorophyll *a* and thus broaden the range of wavelengths that can be used to drive photosynthesis. Some accessory pigments may also function to protect the plant from damage by absorbing and dissipating excess light energy.

Examine the absorption spectrum for chlorophyll *a* (Figure 1). An **absorption spectrum** is a graph showing the relative amount of light absorbed by a pigment as a function of wavelength. Remember that light must be absorbed by a pigment so that photons can excite the electrons that enter photosystems I and II. This particular spectrum shows the absorption at wavelengths from 400 nm - 700 nm (visible light). Note that this pigment has two rather narrow regions of light absorption.

Examine the **photosynthesis** **action spectrum** (Figure 2). This is a graph showing the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts or an intact leaf as a function of wavelength. The activity is determined by measuring the amount of O2 released or CO2 utilized by photosynthesis as the wavelength is varied. Note that again there are two major “peaks” in the graph with a “trough” at about 550 nm.

**Questions**

Why are the peaks in the action spectrum wider than the peaks in the chlorophyll *a* absorption spectrum?   



What are the colours of light at the peak wavelengths? (If you cannot find the answer in your text, try one of the other references available in the lab.)  


What is the colour of light at the trough wavelength? How does this relate to the colour of a typical leaf? 


In Part II of this exercise you will construct an absorption spectrum for spinach extract and compare it to the absorption spectrum for chlorophyll *a* (Figure 1) and the photosynthetic action spectrum (Figure 2). 

**PROCEDURE**

> When introducing any procedure in the lab it might be good for students to be instructed to note down any deviations from the protocol as a best practice for #Potential/Reproducibility

**SAFETY:** 

The solvents are flammable and the fumes are toxic, therefore they should be covered or in the fume hood at all times.

Equipment per group:

* 1 spectrophotometer					
* 1 blank, containing solvent (already prepared)		
* 1 cuvette containing spinach extract dissolved in solvent (already prepared)
* test tube rack or beaker					
* Kimwipes for cleaning the cuvettes 

Turn the spectrophotometer on and let it warm up.

The spinach extract has been prepared by mashing a large handful of fresh spinach leaves (using a mortar and pestle) in pet-ether/acetone (9:1) and is in the fume hood. The resulting extract contains all the pigments that are soluble in this solvent. These chemicals are irritating to the skin and eyes and highly flammable! Please do not remove the plastic lids.

1. Obtain one cuvette/tube of spinach extract (filled at least three-quarters full) and one cuvette/tube containing extraction solvent (this is the blank).

2. Begin with a wavelength of 400 nm and set the Mode to 0-2A.

3. Carefully follow the instructions beside the spectrophotometer to zero the spectrophotometer. The blank corrects for any absorbance the extraction solvent may have at each wavelength. **Make sure you understand the purpose of the blank.**

4. Remove the blank and insert the cuvette containing the extract. Record the absorbance. 

5. Repeat this process at 20 nm intervals up to 700 nm, recording your data in Table 2. **Remember, you must zero the 'Spec' with the blank for each wavelength. Return the cuvettes to the proper storage rack when you are finished.** 

6. **Return your cuvettes to the appropriate rack in the fume hood when you are finished.** 

7. Construct a graph (an absorption spectrum) on page 9, with wavelength as the independent variable. Be sure your graph is properly labelled and has an appropriate title and caption.

> Could refer students to the #Potential/Biology_data_presentation_guidelines doc. Another potential opportunity to do #Skill/Data_visualization with #Potential/RLanguage .

Compare your spinach extract absorption spectrum with the chlorophyll *a* absorption spectrum (Figure 1). Then compare these two spectra with the action spectrum (Figure 2). Identify wavelengths that are not absorbed by chlorophyll *a*, but that can support photosynthesis.

### Part III: PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN ISOLATED CHLOROPLASTS

As written in the equation below, the reaction from left to right represents the overall process of photosynthesis and requires energy. Another way of saying this is that photosynthesis is an endergonic process. This is balanced by the exergonic, or energy-yielding reaction of cellular respiration, from right to left.

              	**(photosynthesis)**                					**requires energy**    
	**6CO2 + 6H2O  ------------> C6H12O6+ 6O2**			
				**<------------**              	 		
				**liberates energy**                
				**(respiration)**

The overall process is not perfect, however. In either direction, considerable energy is dissipated in unusable forms, usually as heat. For this reason, a constant input of light is necessary to keep the whole biosphere going. The light drives the system UP the energy gradient, to the right, so that it can spontaneously run DOWN the energy gradient, to the left. The amounts of energy involved are enormous -- approximately 686,000 calories are required to synthesize a "mole" of glucose (one mole of glucose is approximately 180 grams), and precisely this same amount of energy is released if the glucose is completely consumed during cellular respiration.

**THE PARTIAL REACTIONS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CELLULAR RESPIRATION**

The overall reaction shown in above does not reveal much about the individual reactions involved. In fact, most of this sort of detail is beyond the scope of this course. On the other hand, some of the basic mechanisms can be described without delving into the detail of individual reactions.

Two fundamental processes are the mainstays of photosynthesis and cellular respiration:

1.	Hydrogen atoms in the form of electrons (e-) and protons (H+) are transported within the cell and are put into energetically useful forms. These transfers of H+ and e- are called **"reduction - oxidation"** reactions, or more simply, "red-ox" reactions.

2.	Energy is conserved in the bond energy of ATP, a form which is acceptable to many cellular reactions.

A brief explanation of each of these processes follows:

**Electron Transport and Energy Transformations**:

Light energy causes electrons to be emitted (displaced) from certain chlorophyll pigment molecules. This occurs in two steps, and each stepwise electron emission occurs in discrete groups of chlorophyll molecules called photosystems. The end result of this light driven electron excitation is that water is split into hydrogen atoms (protons and electrons, really) and oxygen (photolysis of water) and these two products are used to form two high-energy compounds. The electrons and protons are attached to a carrier molecule called NADP+, (to form NADPH2) and some energy is set aside in the bond energy of ATP. These two compounds are then used to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide, a process that requires a lot of energy. 

Now that the electrons (as part of the hydrogen atoms in glucose) are stabilized in a relatively high-energy state, cellular respiration can sequentially strip off these electrons and send them to another electron carrier, called NAD+, a molecule which is virtually identical to NADP+, the electron carrier used in photosynthesis. The electrons then tumble down the energy gradient (from NADH) via a series of electron carriers, with some of the energy that is released being used to create a proton gradient which is then used to generate ATP. Water and carbon dioxide are produced during cellular respiration. Since water and carbon dioxide are important substrates in photosynthesis, the cycle is complete!

**Energy Conservation as ATP**:

Clearly, if a cell is to obtain energy (either from the sun or from the bond energy in glucose) and then use it in another form (to produce a cell wall, make a ribosome, or to repair a membrane) there must be some way of coupling the energy-yielding and energy-requiring processes -- some way to store the energy derived from an exergonic reaction to drive an otherwise endergonic one. There must be some common intermediate. In biological systems, this common energy currency is ATP (adenosine triphosphate). It is normally formed by the addition of a phosphate group to ADP (adenosine diphosphate).

**ADP + Phosphate   -------------------------------->** 	**ATP**							**<-------------------------------**					

The breakdown of ATP provides a considerable "package" of energy, an amount which corresponds, of course, to the cost of making it in the first place. This energy is used to drive many cellular reactions, including some familiar ones such as muscle contractions, or active transport of glucose into your cells after a meal.

The attractiveness of the ATP-ADP system is that the cell only has to make one energy-containing molecule that will serve in many diverse reactions. Also, as ATP is used up, ADP and phosphate are again available to make more ATP, assuming that the energy is available. That is, the ATP-ADP system is rechargeable.

**MEASURING REACTION RATES**

As you can tell from the preceding descriptions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration, these two vital energy-yielding processes are complex and involve many steps and intermediates. Critical to our understanding of any processes such as these is the ability to measure the rate of a reaction, both in an overall reaction as well as in the component reactions (if appropriate). Measuring reaction rates as reliably and simply as possible is a cornerstone of much of biochemistry and cell biology. In general, to measure a reaction rate, the amounts of one of the reactants or products is measured and used as an index of the rate of the process. This principle applies to the determination of reaction rates of either overall net reactions or intermediate, partial reactions.

The principles of measuring reaction rates are very simple; select a reactant or product or a specific intermediate and monitor its level or concentration within a reaction vessel. The details of how one might do this monitoring however, can sometimes become complex, depending on the specific reaction being studied as well as the accuracy required of the rate determination. In addition, when reaction rates are being measured it is important to recognize **all** of the variables that can influence reaction rates and take the necessary steps to ensure that they remain constant or are controlled in some way.

Let us consider specifically the process of photosynthesis and some of the different ways of determining its reaction rate. Looking at the overall reaction first, it seems that it should be possible to monitor the concentration of either of the reactants (i.e. H2O or CO2) or either of the products (i.e. O2 or glucose) to determine the reaction rate. In practice, however, because all biological reactions occur within an aqueous environment, it is not possible to follow what is happening to the concentration of water. Any of the other three compounds, however, can be measured to determine the reaction rate of photosynthesis, and protocols for each have been worked out. For example, the concentration of the O2 may be followed using an oxygen electrode, which measures the concentration of this gas specifically within a closed reaction chamber. Or, the amount of oxygen within the system may be followed using a technique, which measures changes in the total gas volume within a closed system. This is a **manometric** **technique**. Manometric techniques are used extensively in science in general, not just in biology, to measure the rates of very diverse reactions.	

Another way to measure reaction rate is the **colorimetric technique.** In this procedure, the appearance or disappearance of a coloured material is monitored as a measure of a reaction rate. Sometimes, one of the actual reactants or products may be coloured and a colorimetric technique can be directly applied. In other situations, the interaction of an intermediate or final product with a coloured marker may be used to indirectly measure the concentration of the intermediate or product and hence measure the rate of the reaction. There are a large number of dye molecules which display different colour states depending on prevailing conditions, (such as pH, redox potential, concentration of ligands) and there are numerous procedures for measuring reaction rates that utilize these compounds.	

In this laboratory, you will use a colorimetric technique as described above, to observe if photosynthesis is occurring in a preparation of isolated chloroplasts. 

**EXAMINATION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN ISOLATED CHLOROPLASTS USING A COLORIMETRIC TECHNIQUE**

Because chloroplasts are large and relatively sturdy organelles, photosynthesis can conveniently be measured in preparations of isolated chloroplasts. Typically, plant cells are gently broken and the chloroplasts are collected into a cold, buffered solution. Your TA has made such a preparation for you to use in this experiment.

In this experiment, the rate of photosynthesis will be studied by monitoring the production of the high-energy product of the light reaction, NADPH2. The blue dye-- DCPIP (2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol) is added to the suspension of chloroplasts and will intercept electrons in the electron transport chain of the chloroplast thylakoid membranes. The blue dye becomes colourless upon accepting an electron from the chain. Thus, decolourization of the dye means that photosynthesis is taking place and that NADPH2 is being produced. The rate of the light reaction is followed by monitoring the decolourization of the dye using a spectrophotometer.

**Procedure**

1.	Four experimental cuvettes are required for this experiment. The contents of each cuvette are outlined in Table III below.

**Note:**

* Cuvette 1 (blank) has no indicator dye present. You will use this cuvette to calibrate the spectrophotometer.	
* Cuvette 2 (dark control) and cuvette 3 (unboiled) have viable chloroplasts in them. Tube 2 is simply protected from the light (i.e. covered with tin foil).
* Cuvette 4 (boiled) contains a preparation of chloroplasts that has been boiled (100oC) for 10 minutes, which denatures all proteins present.   

Table III. Contents of Cuvettes for Photosynthetic Rate Determination

|    Cuvette contents   | Cuvette 1 Blank | Cuvette 2 Dark Control | Cuvette 3 Unboiled | Cuvette 4 Boiled |
|:---------------------:|:---------------:|:----------------------:|:------------------:|:----------------:|
|    Phosphate Buffer   |      3.0 mL     |         3.0 mL         |       3.0 mL       |      3.0 mL      |

|         DCPIP         |      0.0 mL     |         1.0 mL         |       1.0 mL       |        mL        |
| Unboiled Chloroplasts |     15 drops    |        15 drops        |      15 drops      |        ---       |
|  Boiled Chloroplasts  |       ---       |           ---          |         ---        |     15 drops     |

2.	Turn on the spectrophotometer to warm up the instrument, and set the wavelength to 605 nm. For this exercise, you are going to read % transmittance as opposed to absorbance values.

**Questions**

What is the difference between absorbance and % transmittance?



3.	Clean the outside of each cuvette using Kimwipes and then avoid handling the cuvettes except by holding them near the top rim to prevent interference from smudges and fingerprints.  Cover cuvette 2 with foil and prepare a cap of the foil for this cuvette as well. This is the dark control for the experiment. Make sure you can identify each cuvette 

4.	Add the appropriate volumes of phosphate buffer, distilled water and DCPIP to each of the four cuvettes. Obtain dropper bottles of boiled and unboiled chloroplasts from your TA.  Keep both samples on ice to prevent deterioration of the chloroplasts.

5.	Add 15 drops of the unboiled chloroplast suspension to cuvette 1. Cover the top of the cuvette with Parafilm or a cap and invert to mix. **Use cuvette 1 as the blank to calibrate the spectrophotometer using the specific directions provided with the machine. Retain this cuvette to check the calibration of the machine at the end of the experiment.** 

6.	Place the test-tube rack 12 to 15 cm in front of a fluorescent light. If you use an incandescent bulb place a container of water, which will act as a heat sink, between the light and your samples. If you use a fluorescent bulb this is not necessary.

7.	Add 15 drops of the unboiled chloroplast suspension to cuvette 2. Immediately cover and mix cuvette 2, remove the foil sleeve and measure the % transmittance in the spectrophotometer. Record this value as the time 0 reading in Table III. Rewrap cuvette 2 in foil and place it in the test-tube rack in front of the light. 

8.	Add 15 drops of the unboiled chloroplast suspension to cuvette 3, cover, mix and immediately take the time 0 percent transmittance reading and record it in Table III. 

9.	Repeat the procedure with cuvette 4, except add 15 drops of BOILED chloroplast suspension. Record the % transmittance readings in Table IV as above.

**Record additional percent transmittance readings at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes for all cuvettes. Cover and mix the cuvettes by inversion each time prior to taking the reading.**

**What is a primary source research paper?** 

A primary source research paper is an original publication. That is, it is a paper discussing the findings or theories of a scientist and/or scientists written by that scientist and/or scientists. On the other hand, a non-primary source research paper is a paper discussing the findings and theories of a scientist and/or scientists but written by another scientist and/or scientists, reporter, journalist or member of the general public. Primary source papers are written by those individual or individuals that have conducted the research being reported. 

Electronically submit a minimum of three sources from the scientific literature that you will be citing for your research. 


> Could ask for these sources to also be peer reviewed ( #Potential/Peer_review ).**   

> Additionally, could use this as an opportunity to introduce literature reviews and best practices for conducting a #Skill/Literature_review. ie. Could potentially ask students to describe how these studies were found, and the strengths, limitations, and weaknesses of each ie #Potential/Critical_analysis.
