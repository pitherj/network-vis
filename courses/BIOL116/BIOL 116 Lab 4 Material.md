## DNA STRUCTURE AND REPLICATION

### DNA Structure

In almost all living organisms, the carrier of the genetic information is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The DNA molecule consists of two chains of **nucleotides**, joined by hydrogen bonds to form a ladder-like structure, the **double helix**.

Each nucleotide consists of the following three components: 

1. a five-carbon sugar called deoxyribose,
2. a phosphate group which is attached to the 5’ carbon of deoxyribose
3. a nitrogenous base (one of either adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine) which is attached to the 1’ carbon of deoxyribose. The four different base molecules are often abbreviated by a single letter—A for adenine, G for guanine, C for cytosine, and T for thymine. A and G are classified as purines whereas T and C are pyrimidines. 	

Polynucleotide chains arise by forming a bond between the 5’ carbon of the sugar of one nucleotide, with the 3’ carbon of the sugar of another nucleotide. This creates the sugar-phosphate backbone of a polynucleotide chain (see Figures in Chapter 14 in your text). 

As you can see from the figures in your text, the nitrogenous bases sticking out to the side provide natural points for joining the two polynucleotide chains of a DNA molecule. However, the distinctive shapes of the four bases ensure that only certain pairs of bases can form hydrogen bonds (referred to as complimentary base pairing). For example, adenine can bond with thymine, but not with any of the other bases or with itself. Similarly, cytosine can bond with guanine, but not with itself, thymine, or adenine. As a consequence, there are only four possible “rungs” that can exist in a DNA ladder. They are: AT, TA, CG, GC. Because of the details of the shape of the bases, each “rung” is twisted slightly with respect to the one before it and as a result the DNA molecule has the helical shape.The two polynucleotide chains of a DNA molecule are antiparallel which means they run in opposite directions. One polynucleotide runs in the 3’ to 5’ direction whereas the antiparallel polynucleotide is oriented from 5’ to 3’. A template of DNA (i.e. a polynucleotide sequence being used for the synthesis or DNA or RNA) is always read in the 3’ to 5’ direction and a new polynucleotide chain is always synthesized in the 5’ to 3’ direction. 

**Model of DNA Structure**

Obtain a strip of paper approximately 40 cm in length. Construct a DNA molecule approximately 40 base pairs long that consists of two anti-parallel chains of nucleotides connected by hydrogen bonds between complimentary pairs of nitrogen bases. Include sufficient detail to show your understanding and have your TA check that you have completed this correctly. Note that your model represents only a small portion of a molecule of DNA as the length of human chromosomes ranges from approximately 50 million to 250 million base pairs. Do not discard this model as you will need it in the replication exercise below. 

### DNA Replication

DNA carries inherited genetic information in the coded sequence of its nitrogen bases. It is essential that DNA be exactly duplicated from one cell division to the next to maintain the code of heredity. DNA replication occurs during the S phase of interphase and involves a multitude of enzymes and other proteins. For replication to begin, the DNA double helix must first be unwound and separated into two chains of nucleotides called templates. Complementary DNA nucleotides are brought to each template, joined together by DNA polymerase and joined to the template by hydrogen bonds between complimentary base pairs. The new, anti-parallel strands grow in a 5'-to-3' direction off the 3'-to-5' templates. Because the two initial polynucleotide chains were antiparallel, one of the new chains (called the leading strand) can be assembled in a continuous manner but the other new chain (called the lagging strand) must be assembled discontinuously as short chains (Okazaki fragments) which must then be joined together. DNA replication produces two identical double-stranded molecules (called sister chromatids) from the one initial molecule of DNA (see the Figures in Chapter 14 in your text). Each chromatid consists of one of the original polynucleotide chains and one newly synthesized polynucleotide chain; a process referred to as semi-conservative replication. 

**Demonstration of DNA Replication**

Partially separate your paper molecule of DNA into two polynucleotide chains by cutting the hydrogen bonds between base pairs. Your scissors are acting in a comparable role to the enzyme helicase and the separation process occurs at an area referred to as the replication fork. You will have two strands of DNA, known as templates that serve as the backbones for DNA replication. **Replication occurs in a 5'-to-3' direction off a 3'-to-5' template**. 

Get a new 40 cm strip of paper and cut it in half lengthwise. You will use these new strips to create two new complementary polynucleotide chains; one for each template. The new chains must assemble antiparallel to the templates. The replication fork moves along the DNA molecule while DNA replication is occurring. As a result, one of the new polynucleotide chains (called the leading strand) grows in a continuous manner toward the separation point of the two templates**.** On the other template, replication moves away from the separation point of the two templates but still moves in a 5'-to-3' direction. The new polynucleotide chain (called the lagging strand) must form in short, discontinuous segments as the two templates separate and the fragments must be subsequently joined together. You can simulate this by cutting the strip of paper that represents the lagging strand into fragments and subsequently tape the fragments together. Connect the complimentary bases by creating hydrogen bonds with tape. 

When replication is complete, you will have formed two DNA molecules from the one initial molecule. 

**Questions** 

Are the two polynucleotide chains of each molecule anti-parallel? 




Are all the nitrogen bases paired in a complementary fashion? 





Are both DNA molecules identical? 






Have your TA check that you have completed this exercise properly before continuing.

### PROTEIN SYNTHESIS

The information encoded in DNA is used to produce RNAs, and both the proteins that form cellular structure and the enzymes that direct cellular metabolism. The process of protein synthesis consists of two steps: **transcription** and **translation**. First the information in the genes (sequences of DNA) is transcribed into ribonucleic acid (RNA); second, the RNA transcripts are translated to protein (see Chapters 15 & 16 in your text).

RNA differs from DNA in three ways: 

1. The sugar in RNA is ribose whereas the sugar in DNA is deoxyribose.   
2. RNA has the nitrogen base uracil where DNA has thymine.   
3. RNA is usually single stranded where DNA is double stranded.	

Three types of RNA are involved in protein synthesis: **messenger RNA** (mRNA), **ribosomal RNA** (rRNA), and **transfer RNA** (tRNA). All 3 types are synthesized from specific genes on DNA and all are involved in protein synthesis. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the genetic information from the nucleus to the cell’s cytoplasm where the synthesis of proteins occurs. It contains the genetic message of a portion of the DNA molecule and is synthesized from RNA nucleotides complimentary to the nitrogen base sequence on the DNA template. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a structural component of ribosomes. It does not contain a genetic message. Transfer RNA (tRNA) functions to transport amino acids to the ribosomes during protein synthesis. Transfer RNA molecules have codes for specific amino acids and codes that determine where they may align on a mRNA template. 

Polypeptides consist of chains of amino acids joined by peptide bonds. The base sequence of DNA specifies which amino acids should be present in the polypeptide encoded for by the gene. There are only four different nitrogen bases in DNA and there are 20 different amino acids commonly found in cells. If each base specified a particular amino acid, DNA would only be able to code for four of the 20 amino acids! How long is the message that specifies an amino acid? The genetic code consists of three bases which provides 64 different possible codes (43) for amino acids; more than enough messages for the 20 different amino acids found in cells. This three-base code in DNA is called a triplet code. The triplet code on DNA is transcribed to mRNA as a complimentary series of **codons** which are then translated in the cytoplasm of the cell to the appropriate sequence of amino acids. In addition to coding for specific amino acids, some codons act as punctuation marks to signal the beginning or the ending of the mRNA. One start codon (AUG) signals that translation should start at that point on the mRNA molecule. The AUG codon also codes for the amino acid methionine. Stop or termination codons signal that the polypeptide is complete and end the translation process. UAA, UAG and UGA serve as termination codons. 

### TRANSCRIPTION

During transcription, an RNA polymerase complex binds to the DNA and opens up the helix. The RNA polymerase complex recognizes certain areas rich in adenine-thymine base pairs. These areas are called "promoter regions" and transcription or RNA synthesis begins here. The polymerase complex moves from the 3'-to-5' end of the DNA template and synthesizes a **complementary** strand of mRNA with the opposite polarity. During this process, the genetic code contained on the DNA template is transcribed to a molecule of mRNA. Transcription occurs in the nucleus of the cell. While the rules of complimentary base pairing apply to transcription, RNA nucleotides do not have the nitrogen base thymine but instead, have a different pyrimidine called uracil (U). Transcription is complete when the RNA polymerase complex arrives at a second area rich in A-T base pairs that serves as a terminator sequence. When transcription is complete, the RNA polymerase and the completed mRNA molecule will be released. 

The initial mRNA transcript will undergo processing before leaving the nucleus as a mature mRNA. There are many regions on the DNA (and therefore on the initial mRNA transcript) that do not code for amino acids in the polypeptide encoded by the gene. These series of nucleotides (called introns) must be removed and adjacent coding regions (called exons) joined together before the mRNA exits the nucleus for translation in the cytoplasm. As a result, genes and the initial mRNA transcript synthesized are much larger than the mature mRNAs that leave the nucleus of the cell. Does this seem like an efficient process and can you think of any advantages to this approach? 



Before leaving the nucleus, the mature mRNA transcript will also be given a cap at the 5’ end (consisting of 3 phosphate groups and a molecule called m7G) and a polyA tail (which is a series of adenine residues) at the 3’ end. 

**Demonstration of Transcription**

You have been provided with a very small gene (a portion of a molecule of DNA) and will synthesize a molecule of mRNA complementary to the DNA template. The average size of genes is about 3000 base pairs and your gene is only 24 base pairs! The largest human gene encodes for the protein dystrophin and is 2.4 million base pairs in length. 

Place your DNA template on your bench top. Obtain a strip of paper that is the same length as your DNA template. Create a molecule of mRNA that is complimentary to the base sequence on the DNA template. Use the lower of the two polynucleotide chains and read it from 3’ to 5’ (i.e. left to right). The new molecule of mRNA must be synthesized from 5’ to 3’ and antiparallel to the DNA template. Also, recall that while DNA has the nitrogen base thymine, RNA nucleotides have uracil not thymine. 

Your mRNA molecule should include 24 nucleotides. It contains the genetic code of the DNA to direct the synthesis of a specific polypeptide. 

Do not join the mRNA polynucleotide chain to the DNA template.

Note that this paper demonstration of transcription does not account for mRNA processing.

### TRANSLATION

During translation, the sequence of bases on mRNA is used to order the amino acids to form a polypeptide. Recall that three mRNA nucleotides form a **codon** and code for one specific amino acid. The mature mRNA formed within the nucleus, leaves the nucleus via the nuclear pores. Within the cytoplasm, the mRNA serves as a template for protein synthesis. Ribosomes (containing rRNA and proteins) associate with the mRNA beginning at the start sequence codon. As the ribosomes move along the mRNA, they read the codons starting at the 5' end of the mRNA. The amino acids to be incorporated into the protein are picked up by molecules of transfer RNA (tRNA) and different species of tRNA molecules are specific for specific amino acids. The tRNAs bring their specific amino acids to the ribosome as it moves along the mRNA. A ribosome has three binding sites for tRNA molecules; A, P and E. A tRNA with its amino acid arrives initially at the A site of the ribosome. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, the amino acid on the tRNA in the A site is joined to the amino acid on the tRNA in the P site and hence the polypeptide chain grows. The tRNA in the E site no longer has an amino acid attached and will be released to the cytoplasm. Each tRNA can only align on the mRNA at the point where its anti-codon is complimentary to the mRNA codon. This ordering of the tRNA’s along the mRNA determines the order of the amino acids to be linked together to form the protein.  When the ribosome reaches the termination codon, the polypeptide will be released and translation is complete. The message that was transcribed on the mRNA has been translated to the polypeptide formed.

**Demonstration of Translation**

Use the mRNA molecule that you synthesized earlier. Position it on your desk with the 5' end to the left and the 3' end to the right. In the following chart, write each of the eight mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons in the appropriate order. Use the codon table provided below to determine the amino acid for which each mRNA codon codes. Notice that the last amino acid is not present because the last codon codes for termination of protein synthesis.

**Alternate Alleles**
Genes exist in alternate forms called alleles in which the sequence of nitrogen bases varies. Use the alternate allele of the gene provided and complete the transcription and translation exercise as described above. 

| DNA  Triplet   | 3’    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 5'    |

| tRNA anticodon | xxxxx |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | xxxxx |

**Questions**

How does the polypeptide formed by the alternate allele differ from the polypeptide formed in the first instance?



Do you think this difference is likely of any functional significance? Why or why not?




### Mutations

A mutation refers to any permanent change in the sequence of bases on DNA. Mutations arise for many different reasons and can take a variety of forms. 

A **point mutation** is a change in a single base on DNA. The significance of a point mutation can be appreciated by examining a human genetic disorder called **sickle cell disease**. Hemoglobin is a protein abundant in red blood cells. It consists of four polypeptides; two alpha globin molecules and two beta globin molecules. Individuals, who have inherited the gene for sickle cell disease, have a point mutation in the gene for beta globin. On the template strand of DNA, the base in the second position of the sixth triplet for this gene is adenine in place of thymine resulting in CAC instead of CTC. How does this affect the amino acid sequence (or primary structure) of the beta globin polypeptide? 


As a result of this change to the primary structure of beta globin, the hemoglobin protein will crystallize when the red blood cells are exposed to reduced oxygen concentrations which causes the cells to become sickle-shaped. The misshapen cells create a complex series of physiological problems for the individual. A person with two normal alleles for beta globin produces only normal hemoglobin. An individual with one copy of the normal allele for beta globin and one copy of the mutant allele produces both normal and abnormal hemoglobin and is referred to as having sickle cell trait. An individual with two copies of the mutant allele produces only mutant beta globin and therefore all abnormal hemoglobin and has sickle cell anemia. 

**Questions**

Do you think point mutations are always deleterious? Why or why not?


**Frame shift mutations** result from the **addition or deletion** of a nucleotide and therefore shift the reading frame for translation often resulting in substantial alterations to the polypeptide synthesized. Consider the following sequence of bases on a DNA template;
		3’ – TAC – TGC – GTG – CTG - 5’

What mRNA codons and amino acids would result from the transcription and translation of this sequence?
mRNA codons:	//_ //_ //_ //_ 
amino acids:	//_ //_ //_ //_ 

Consider the implications of adding an additional base (G) at the fourth position so that the DNA template becomes;
		3’ - TAC – GTG – CGT – GCT – C - 5’

Now what mRNA codons and amino acids would result from the transcription and translation of this sequence?
mRNA codons:	//_ //_ //_ //_ //_
amino acids:	//_ //_ //_ //_ //_

One of the most serious, simply inherited human genetic disorders, **cystic fibrosis (CF)**, results from a **deletion** in the gene that codes for a transmembrane protein (called CFTR – cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). The gene for CFTR is located on chromosome number 7 and contains about 170,000 base pairs. CFTR is a transmembrane protein found in the cell membranes of epithelial cells lining the passageways of the lungs, liver, pancreas, intestines and reproductive tract. CFTR consists of 1480 amino acids and serves as a channel for chloride ions for diffusion across the cell membrane. 

**Questions**

Why is the CFTR gene more than three times larger than the CFTR protein?



When the chloride channel created by CFTR is open, chloride ions diffuse out of the cell. Sodium ions will follow because of the electrical gradient created, and water will follow by osmosis. In individuals with CF, the blockage of ion and water transport out of these epithelial cells results in a layer of thicker, more viscous mucous on the cells’ surfaces. This mucous obstructs airways and glands, and traps bacteria making individuals with CF prone to chronic infections. While over 1000 different mutations to the CFTR gene have now been described, about 70% of CF patients have a deletion of three base pairs (GAA) resulting in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508 in the protein. As a result, the quality-control mechanism in the endoplasmic reticulum recognizes that this protein is not folded correctly which results in the defective CFTR protein being degraded before even reaching the cell membrane.

**Questions**

The normal DNA nucleotide sequence in the region of CFTR gene involved in CF is;
		3’ –TAG – TAG – AAA – CCA – CAA - 5’ 

What is the sequence of mRNA codons that results normally from the transcription of this region and what amino acids would be present in this region of the polypeptide?
mRNA codons	//_ //_ //_ //_ //_
amino acids	//_ //_ //_ //_ //_

Now determine the mRNA codons and amino acids present in the polypeptide if the three nucleotides that are underlined are deleted.
mRNA codons	//_ //_ //_ //_ //_
amino acids	//_ //_ //_ //_ //_

Why do both the TAG and TAA triplets code for the amino acid “ile”?

### Summary of protein synthesis

Protein synthesis involves:
the transcription of mRNA from the DNA template, and
the translation of the message on the mRNA to the correct sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide produced.
