# Exam Review and Experiment Continued

**For this week:**

* Review for your lab exam
* Continue with your experiment

**For next week:**

* Download R and R studie as per the instructions
* Review power point for data tutorial
* Bring laptop and power cord (at least one person in the group must have one)

> It would be interesting for students to do an #Potential/Open_notebooks with respect to their lab questions and experiment. The TAs could just do a completion check at the end of the term, or weekly?
