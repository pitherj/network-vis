**Course Description:**

**BIOL 116 (3) Biology for Science Majors**
First of a pair of courses that introduce students to the biological concepts necessary to continue into second-year biology.  Covers evolutionary theory and its underlying genetic basis, basic cell biology, plant and animal nutrition, and energy acquisition.  Credit will not be granted for both Biol 116/125 and Biol 117/122.

Prerequisite:  Either (a) all of Biology 11 (Biology 12 is strongly recommended), Chemistry 11; or (b) all of Chemistry 11, BIOL 104.
Corequisite:  One of CHEM 111, CHEM 121 is recommended

**Laboratory Objectives: **

The Biology 116 lab exercises complement and enhance the lecture portion of your course, and a thorough understanding of the lecture material will make the lab work more meaningful.

**Laboratory Format:**

Labs are weekly three-hour exercises with multiple lab assignment, a lab exam and an oral presentation.

**Laboratory Meeting times:**

BIOL 116 labs are held in Fipke 247/249 and SCI 119, and start the week of September 9th.   Please check your registration to determine your lab section and time.  You must ONLY attend the section you are registered for.  Unless you have received written consent from the coordinator, you will receive a mark of zero for any lab section attended that you are not registered for.

Note: Attendance of labs is mandatory unless there is a valid medical or compassionate reason.  Students who are late without a valid documented excuse will not be allowed into the lab, and will receive a mark of zero for the pre-lab quiz and the laboratory assignment.  All medical documentation needs to be provided to the coordinator within 48 hours of the missed lab. Self-declaration forms are not valid as medical documentation.  Students must pass both the lecture and laboratory part of a course to pass the course; please refer to the Repeat Course Policy.

**Required Materials:**

The lab manual is available on Canvas.  You are expected to bring the manual to the lab with you, to have read the manual before your lab and where applicable, to have watched any pre-lab videos posted on Canvas.








**Course Evaluation: **

The lab constitutes 30% of your grade in this course and consists of the following:

| Evaluation           | Value (total out of 30) | Week of:            |
|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Assignments          | 5                       | Throughout the term |
| Final Press Release  | 3                       | October 21st        |
| Lab Exam             | 15                      | November 18th       |
| Poster Presentations | 7                       | November 25th       |

Final grades will be based on the evaluations listed above and the final grade will be assigned according to the standardized grading system outlined in the UBC Okanagan Calendar.

**Missed Assignments and Exams: **

From UBC Okanagan Academic Calendar/Policies and Regulations/Academic Concession

“Students who, because of unforeseen events, are absent during the term and are unable to complete tests or other graded work, should normally discuss with their instructors how they can make up for missed work, according to written guidelines given to them at the start of the course. Instructors are not required to make allowance for any missed test or incomplete work that is not satisfactorily accounted for.  If ill health is an issue, students are encouraged to seek attention from a health professional.  Campus Health and Counselling will normally provide documentation only to students who have been seen previously at these offices for treatment or counselling specific to conditions associated with their academic difficulties.  Students who feel that requests for consideration have not been dealt with fairly by their instructors may take their concerns first to the Head of the discipline, and if not resolved, to the Office of the Dean. Further information can be found at:
http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,48,0,0.

**Students may be excused from laboratories only with a physician’s certificate verifying illness or other supporting documents for a compassionate leave.  If a student is unable to complete a laboratory or a laboratory exam for a good and verifiable documented reason, the marks may be redistributed. Please talk to your TA and the lab coordinator as soon as possible if ill or if you will be missing a laboratory or a lab exam. Self-declaration forms are not valid as medical documentation Holidays are not acceptable reasons for missing labs.**

**Repeat Course Policy:**

Students who have successfully completed a course with a lab who wish to repeat the course for a more favorable grade, or a student who wishes to repeat the failed portion of the course may do so, if, and only if, the following requirements are met:

* If the student failed the laboratory portion of the course, but achieved a grade of at least C (60%) in the lecture portion of the course, the student may opt to repeat only the laboratory portion.

* If the student failed the lecture portion of the course, but achieved a grade of at least C (60%) in the laboratory portion of the course, the student may opt to repeat only the lecture portion.

* The course must be taken again within two years of the term in which the student was originally enrolled in the course (e.g. if the course was originally taken in the Fall term of 2014, the last possible term in which the student can repeat the course is Fall of 2016).

* In situations where the weighting of the lab/lecture component changes from year to year (e.g. 30% lab, 70% lecture in one year; 40% lab, 60% lecture in another year), it will be at the discretion of the instructor teaching the course and/or the lab coordinator the second time to decide the weighting in the calculation of the new grade.

* The student must complete the “Repeat course” form found on the Biology web page (http://biol.ok.ubc.ca/forms.html) and submit it by email to biology.okanagan@ubc.ca or to the Unit Administrative Assistant (Ms. Jennifer Rhodes, SCI 161) by the last day of the late registration period.

Please note that the university policy is that the student must register and pay for the complete course, and not just a portion of the course.

**Academic Integrity:**
 
The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences. 

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the policies and procedures, may be found at:

If you have any questions about how academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor.
